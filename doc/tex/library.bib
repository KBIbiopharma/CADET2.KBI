abstract = {Chromatographic processes provide a powerful tool for the separation of multicomponent mixtures in which the components have different adsorption affinities. As an alternative to conventional batch chromatography as a discontinuous process, the simulated moving bed (SMB) process as a continuous chromatographic separation process gained more and more impact recently. Mathematical modelling and simulation of batch chromatographic processes is widely documented in the literature. For the modelling of SMB chromatographic processes two different strategies exist. The first one considers the corresponding true moving bed process neglecting the cyclic switching and thus the dominating dynmics of the process. The second alternative which is considered within this framework is to connect dynamic models of single chromatographic columns while considering the cyclic port switching in order to represent the dynamics of the real process correctly. We here describe three different approaches for the modelling and simulation of chromatographic separation processes with nonlinear adsorption thermodynamics described by the Langmuir isotherm. The first one is a rigorous modelling and numerical simulation approach, the second one is based on the equilibrium theory and proceeds from the analytical solution for binary separation processes based on nonlinear wave propagation. The third approach only includes nonidealities caused by the limited mass transfer rates. All approaches are analyzed and compared with respect to complexity, accuracy and computational time.},

abstract = {A theoretical calculation of the separation performance of a (hypothetical) micro-structured monolithic LC column is presented, confirming that the polydispersity effect in parallel bundle columns can theoretically be eliminated to a very large extent by radially redistributing the mobile phase fluid at regular intervals. It is demonstrated that the flow can be redistributed in such a way that the advantage coming from the suppression of the polydispersity effect largely exceeds the losses caused by the additional pressure-drop and band broadening. The presently considered micro-structured column would allow to perform N>100[punctuation space]000 plate separations in a few hundred of seconds, i.e., about an order of magnitude faster than the best possible packed bed and monolithic HPLC columns, while offering the same mass loadability. This clearly demonstrates that the currently available LC columns are still far away from the absolute resolution limit of the ideal, fully optimised LC column.},

abstract = {A transport model that considers pore diffusion, external film resistance, finite kinetic rate and column dispersed flow, was used to mathematically describe a frontal affinity chromatography system. The corresponding differential equations system was solved in a simple and accurate form by using the numerical method of lines (MOL). The solution was compared with experimental data from literature and the analytic Thomas solution. The frontal affinity chromatography of lysozyme to Cibacron Blue Sepharose CL-6B was used as a model system. A good fit to the experimental data was made with the simulated runs of the transport model using the MOL solution. This approach was used to perform a parametric analysis of the experimental frontal affinity system. The influence of process and physical parameters on the frontal affinity chromatography process was investigated. The MOL solution of the transport model results in an unique and simple way to predict frontal affinity performance as well a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the separation.},

abstract = {Despite the preponderance of models in the literature, chromatographic process development in industrial protein purification has traditionally been based on heuristic knowledge and expertise. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using a mathematical model to guide process development and optimization. The development of an anion-exchange step to separate an antibody from its dimer is used as a paradigm to test this approach to process development. In the approach involving models, we show that the work required may be reduced to the task of determining conditions for adequate selectivity. Once these conditions are obtained, the steric mass action formalism is used to predict the preparative experimental results. Our results indicate that this model is able to accurately predict experimental results under high loadings with minimal parameter estimation. Finally, we identify ways in which such models can be used to increase productivity and process robustness.},

abstract = {We quantified the microstructural disorder of packed beds and correlated it with the resulting eddy dispersion. For this purpose we designed a set of bulk (unconfined) monodisperse random sphere packings with a systematic, protocol-dependent degree of microstructural heterogeneity, covering a porosity range from the random-close to the random-loose packing limit ([var epsilon] = 0.366-0.46). With the precise knowledge of particle positions, size, and shape we conducted a Vorono\"{\i} tessellation of all packings and correlated the statistical moments of the Vorono\"{\i} volume distributions (standard deviation and skewness) with the porosity and the protocol-dependent microstructural disorder. The deviation of the Vorono\"{\i} volume distributions from the delta function of a crystalline packing describes the origin of short-range disorder of the investigated random packings. Eddy dispersion was simulated over a wide range of reduced velocities (0.5 <= [nu] <= 750) and analyzed with the comprehensive Giddings equation. Transient dispersion was found to correlate with the spatial scales of heterogeneity in the packings. The analysis of short-range disorder based on the Vorono\"{\i} volume distributions revealed a strong correlation with the short-range interchannel contribution to eddy dispersion, whereas transchannel dispersion was relatively little affected. The presented approach defines a strictly scientific route to the key morphology-transport relationships of current and future chromatographic supports, including their morphological reconstruction, statistical analysis, and the correlation with relevant transport phenomena. It also guides us in our understanding, comparison, and optimization of the diverse packing algorithms and protocols used in simulations and experimental studies.},

abstract = {Diffusion coefficients of proteins in chromatographic media are important parameters for the rational design of stationary phases and purification schemes. In contrast to free diffusion, intraparticle diffusion is hindered by the porous structure of the media. Direct intraparticle diffusion analysis (IDA) is a novel approach for the determination of intraparticle protein diffusion coefficients. IDA is based on the evaluation of spatially and temporally resolved intraparticle concentration profiles. To prevent adsorption and to study diffusion only, the chromatographic media are investigated in underivatized form. With IDA, intraparticle concentration profiles are measured in a microcolumn by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). From this dynamic data, the diffusion coefficients are determined by parameter estimation, using a spheric diffusion model. The boundary condition is given by the measured protein concentration in the bulk phase. IDA is applied to determine intraparticle diffusion coefficients of seven different proteins in Sepharose 6 FF. The results show excellent congruence of experimental data and simulation results. Moreover, the determined diffusion coefficients lie well within the range of data published in the literature. Given that the material in question allows optical analysis, IDA is a general approach for studying protein diffusion in porous particles and is easily adapted to different proteins, solution conditions and stationary phases.},

In a first stage, the polyclonal mixture is characterized using both chromatographic and non-chromatography methods. This analysis suggested that the mixture can be simplified by lumping the different components of the IgG into two "macro-components", referred to as pseudo-variants in the following. An analytical method for the determination of the concentrations of the two pseudo-variants is developed. Based on this, the mass transport and the adsorption isotherm parameters are determined experimentally using only well known sort-cut methods. This analysis is evidencing the complexity of the characterization when operating in the presence of slow diffusing mixtures of components. Even in the presence of strong competition, mass transport plays a major role in determining the peak shape. In frontal analysis, competition is still operative after full saturation of the column.},

It makes use of transformed concentration variables, which were first introduced by Doherty and co-workers for the steady state design of reactive distillation processes (Proc. Roy. Soc. London A 413 (1987a) 459). It is shown that these transformed variables can be directly generalized to the dynamic problem considered here. Further, they can also be applied to other reactive separation processes like fixed bed as well as countercurrent chromatographic reactors, for example. They provide profound insight into the dynamic behavior of these processes and reveal bounds of feasible operation caused by reactive azeotropy. It is shown that reactive azeotropy, which is a well-known phenomenon in reactive distillation (Proc. Roy. Soc.

abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy has been previously applied to the study of protein uptake in porous chromatography resins. This method requires labeling the protein with a fluorescent probe. The labeled protein is then diluted with a large quantity of native protein so that the fluorescence intensity is a linear function of the labeled protein concentration. Ideally, the attachment of a fluorescent probe should not affect the affinity of the protein for the stationary phase; however, recent experimental work has shown that this assumption is difficult to satisfy. In the present study, we present a mathematical model of protein diffusion and adsorption in a single adsorbent particle. The differences in adsorption behavior of labeled and native protein are accounted for by treating the system as a two-component system (labeled and native protein) described by the steric mass action isotherm (SMA). SMA parameters are regressed from experimental linear gradient elution data for lysozyme and lysozyme-dye conjugates (for the fluorescent dyes Cy3, Cy5, Bodipy FL, and Atto635). When the regressed parameters are employed in the model, an overshoot in the labeled lysozyme concentration is predicted for Cy5- and Bodipy-labeled lysozyme, but not for Atto635-labeled lysozyme. The model predictions agree qualitatively well with recent work showing the dependence of the concentration overshoot on the identity of the attached dye and provide further evidence that the overshoot is likely caused by the change of binding characteristics due to the fluorescent label. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Testing was performed with five different proteins: anti-Factor VII monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G), aprotinin, bovine serum albumin, lipolase and myoglobin. The dependence of pH on retention varies from generally low to very high for proteins with a low isoelectric point (pI). An unexpected binding at pH 7-8 of aprotinin with pI >11 was observed on Separon HemaBio 1000Q. No link between pH dependence on retention and titration curves of the different resins was observed. Efficiency results show the expected trend of higher dependence of the plate height with increasing flow-rate of soft resins compared to resins for medium- and high-pressure operation. No or a very small difference in particle size distribution was obtained between new and used resins. Binding to anion-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength varies to some extent depending on the specific protein. Generally, binding and elution at high salt concentration may be performed with Q Sepharose XL, Toyopearl QAE 550c, Q Sepharose HP and Poros 50 HQ, while binding and elution at low salt concentration may be performed with Q-Cellthru Bigbeads Plus. A very high binding capacity was obtained with Q Sepharose XL. Comparison of static capacity and dynamic capacity at 10\% breakthrough shows approx. 50-80\% utilization of the total available capacity during chromatographic operation. A general good agreement was obtained between this study and data obtained by the suppliers. The results of this study may be used for selection of resins for testing in process development.},

abstract = {A comparative study on weak anion exchangers was performed to investigate the pH dependence, binding strength, particle size distribution, and static and dynamic capacity of the chromatographic resins. The resins tested included: DEAE Sepharose FF, Poros 50 D, Fractogel EMD DEAE (M), MacroPrep DEAE Support, DEAE Ceramic HyperD 20, and Toyopearl DEAE 650 M. Testing was performed with five different model proteins: Anti-FVII mAb (immunoglobulin G), aprotinin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Lipolase (Novozymes), and myoglobin. Retention showed an expected increasing trend as a function of pH for proteins with low pI. A decrease in retention was observed for some resins at pH 9 likely due to initiation of deprotonation of the weak anion-exchange ligands. Expected particle size distribution was obtained for all resins compared to previous studies. Binding strength to weak anion-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength depends on the specific protein. Binding and elution at low salt concentration may be performed with Toyopearl DEAE 650 M, while binding and elution at high salt concentration may be performed with MacroPrep DEAE Support. Highest binding capacities were generally obtained with Poros 50 D followed by DEAE Ceramic HyperD 20. A general good agreement was obtained between this study and data obtained by the suppliers. Verification of binding strength trends with model proteins was achieved with human growth hormone (hGH) and a hGH variant on the same resins with different elution salts, sodium chloride, sodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium sulphate, and sodium acetate. Static capacity measurements obtained in the traditional experimental set-up were compared with high-throughput screening (HTS) technique experiments with reasonable agreement. Isotherm data obtained from HTS techniques and pulse experiments were successfully combined with mathematical modelling to simulate, develop and optimise the separation process of two model proteins, Lipolase and BSA. The data presented in this paper may be used for selection of resins for testing in process development.},

abstract = {Process development, optimization and robustness analysis for chromatographic separation are often entirely based on experimental work and generic knowledge. This paper describes a model-based approach that can be used to gain process knowledge and assist in the robustness analysis of an ion-exchange chromatography step using a model-based approach. A kinetic dispersive model, where the steric mass action model accounts for the adsorption is used to describe column performance. Model calibration is based solely on gradient elution experiments at different gradients, flow rates, pH and column loads. The position and shape of the peaks provide enough information to calibrate the model and thus single-component experiments can be avoided. The model is calibrated to the experiments and the confidence intervals for the estimated parameters are used to account for the model error throughout the analysis. The model is used to predict the result of a robustness analysis conducted as a factorial experiment and to design a robust pooling approach. The confidence intervals are used in a "worst case" approach where the parameters for the components are set at the edge of their confidence intervals to create a worst case for the removal of impurities at each point in the factorial experiment. The pooling limit was changed to ensure product quality at every point in the factorial analysis. The predicted purities and yields were compared to the experimental results to ensure that the prediction intervals cover the experimental results.},

abstract = {The oxidation of ethane was studied over a VOx/[gamma]-Al2O3 catalyst (1.4\% V) in a laboratory fixed bed reactor. Ethylene, CO and CO2 were observed as the main products. To analyze the reaction network the oxidation of ethylene and CO was investigated in the same range of operation conditions. Based on the results obtained, a reaction network for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation can be proposed consisting of five partial reactions. Ethane reacts in two parallel reactions to ethylene (1) and directly to CO2 (2). From the formed ethylene two further parallel pathways lead to CO (3) and CO2 (4). Thus, ethylene over-oxidation is the source for CO observed during ethane oxidation. Finally, the consecutive oxidation of CO to CO2 (5) is a part of the network. To understand the role of the catalyst, experiments were carried out comparing the performance of the VOx/[gamma]-Al2O3 catalyst with that of the pure [gamma]-alumina support and a FeOx/[gamma]-Al2O3 catalyst. From these experiments it can be concluded that ethane conversion is correlated with the Broenstedt basic properties of the catalyst. Ethylene selectivity reveals an opposite trend. Ethylene formation from ethane consumes lattice oxygen, which can only be provided by redox sites of the catalyst. In contrast, deep oxidation reactions of both hydrocarbons (reactions 2-4) do not depend on the presence of redox sites, but only on the presence of gas phase oxygen. These deep oxidation reactions can be considered as surface reactions. Finally, CO oxidation (reaction 5) occurs primarily again under consumption of lattice oxygen, but under oxygen excess conditions also through surface reactions. In addition, two sources of carbon formation were identified, ethylene pyrolysis under oxygen absence and Boudouard reactions. For the network of the five main reactions, kinetic parameters were estimated. Reaction 1 was described by a Mars van Krevelen mechanism, the reactions 2-5 by Langmuir Hinshelwood equations. Applying this model a satisfactory fit of all experimental data was obtained.},

Three different competitive isotherm models, i.e., Langmuir, biLangmuir and T\'{o}th, combined with transport-dispersive chromatographic model were used in predicting the elution profiles. Orthogonal collocation on finite element (OCFE) method was applied to obtain the calculated elution profiles.

Band profiles calculated from both isotherm models are in good agreement with the experimental data.

We demonstrate the impact of the confinement and its cross-sectional geometry (circular, quadratic, semicircular) on transient and asymptotic transverse and longitudinal dispersion in random sphere packings, and also address the influence of protocol-dependent packing disorder and the particle-aspect ratio. Plate height curves are analyzed with the Giddings equation to quantify the transcolumn contribution to eddy dispersion. Confined packings are compared with confined arrays under the condition of identical bed porosity, conduit cross-sectional area, and laterally fully equilibrated geometrical wall and corner effects on dispersion. Fluid dispersion in a regular pillar array is stronger affected by the macroscopic confinement and does not resemble eddy dispersion in random sphere packings, because the regular microstructure cannot function as a mechanical mixer like the random morphology. Giddings' coupling theory fails to preserve the nature of transverse dispersion behind the arrays' plate height curves, which approach a linear velocity-dependence as transverse dispersion becomes velocity-independent. Upon confinement this pseudo-diffusive behavior can outweigh the performance advantage of the regular over the random morphology.},

The relationship between the number of theoretical plates, fluid residence time, and column separation performance was quantified using modeling simulations. The simulations showed the separation depended on both the fluid residence time and the number of theoretical plates. However, when the number of theoretical plates was increased to >=150, the simulations predicted that the separation performance of the column was not significantly improved. The approach described here could be used as a method to quantify acceptable height equivalent of a theoretical plate values for columns, and serve as a tool to understand how column packing quality impacts a given chromatographic separation prior to column scale-up, as well as during the monitoring of column lifetime in the manufacturing of large scale protein therapeutics.},

abstract = {The isotropic algorithm is constructed for random close packing of equisized spheres with triply periodic boundary conditions. All previously published packing methods with periodic boundaries were kinetics-determined; i.e., they contained a densification rate as an arbitrary parameter. In contrast, the present algorithm is kinetic-independent and demonstrates an unambiguous convergence to the experimental results. To suppress crystallization, the main principles of our algorithm are (1) to form a contact network at an early stage and (2) retain contacts throughout the densification, as far as possible. The particles are allowed to swell by the numerical solution of the differential equations of densification. The RHS of these equations is calculated efficiently from a linear system by a combination of conjugate gradient iterations and exact sparse matrix technology. When an excessive contact occurs and one of the existing bonds should be broken to continue the densification, an efficient criterion based on multidimensional simplex geometry is used for searching the separating bond. The algorithm has a well-defined termination point resulting in a perfect contact network with the average coordination number six (for particle number N>1) and a system of normal reactions between the spheres maintaining the structure. These forces are the counterpart of the algorithm and can be used to calculate small elastic particle deformations in a granular medium. Extensive calculations are presented for 50 <= N 5 400 and demonstrate very good agreement with the experimental packing density (about 0.637 ) and structure.},

abstract = {We present a series of numerically calculated plate height and flow resistance data obtained for an idealized chromatographic support mimic with variable bed porosity (0.3 epsilon 0.9), yielding a unique insight into how the main chromatographic performance parameters can be expected to vary with the external bed porosity, unbiased by any differences in molecular diffusivity or retention factor. The influence of pore heterogeneity effects is considered as well. It is found that the product hminnuopt depends only very weakly on epsilon and on the degree of pore heterogeneity. It is also found that the minimal separation impedance Emin decreases monotonically with epsilon. This shows that the minimal plate height increase that can be expected for large porosity systems is always more than compensated by their reduced flow resistance, in agreement with the current observations in real silica monolith columns. Using the computed plate height data in an optimization analysis, it is found that large porosity supports can always potentially yield shorter analysis times or larger plate numbers than small porosity supports but need submicrometer feature sizes to actually achieve this. Assuming a lower limit on the producible or useable structural feature sizes, it is found that small N separations can best be performed with a small porosity packing, whereas large N separations require a large porosity packing if the column length (L) is left free. A plot yielding epsilonopt as a function of the required plate number has been established, showing that roughly epsilonopt log(N) in both the ordered and the disordered support cases. It is also shown that the maximal increase in peak capacity ever to be expected from the use of high porosity supports is a factor of 2 (if the mobile-phase viscosity can be kept constant), potentially to be increased by a factor of 1.5 by increasing the homogeneity of the packing.},

An additional plug flow reactor (PFR) is connected in series with the CSTR network in order to account for a time-lag that is not associated with the system dispersion. The capability of the model to describe experimental breakthrough data is compared to the frequently applied standard model for extra-membrane system dispersion, which consists of a single CSTR in series with a PFR. Non-binding conditions are deliberately chosen for studying the impact of module geometries on breakthrough curves separately from chromatographic membrane performance. The commercial CIM module and a custom designed cell (Scell) are studied with acetone and lysozyme as test tracers at varied flow rates and for various membrane pore sizes under non-binding conditions. In all studied cases, the proposed model fits the measured breakthrough curves better than the standard model. Moreover, the minimal number of radial flow zones that are required to accurately describe observed breakthrough curves and the estimated flow fractions through these zones provide valuable information for the analysis and optimization of internal module designs.},

abstract = {The effect of neutral salts on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in salting out and chromatography of proteins is treated by a simple theory. The electrostatic energy change in these processes is expressed according to the classical theory. The corresponding hydrophobic energy change is evaluated from the nonpolar contact area of the interacting species and the corrected surface tension of the medium. The property of a salt that affects hydrophobic interactions is quantified by its molal surface tension increment. This parameter is a measure of the increase in surface tension by the salt and forms the basis of a natural lyotropic series. In agreement with the theory, the analysis of solubility and Chromatographic data shows that the overall salt effect can be described by the two antagonistic effects of salts on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The expression derived for the salting-out constant is employed to calculate the relative surface hydrophobicity of proteins. The results suggest that the salt effect is not only useful in the quantitative treatment of hydrophobic interactions but also in the measurement of hydrophobic properties.},

However, the common shape of a Darcy-type relation is retained by assigning all nonlinearities to a general permeability tensor. Finally, to show the validity and applicability of the proposed formulation, the filter law is correlated with the data of permeability experiments on a high-porosity polyurethane foam and is used in a 3-d finite element analysis to simulate the pneumatic damping properties of the material.},

It is also shown that the use of the existing B-term expressions can lead to very large measurement errors (up to a 100\% and more) for the determination of the stationary phase diffusion coefficient [gamma]sDs from peak parking experiments. The representation of the B-term diffusion should in the future hence be based on the Deff expressions that can be derived from the EMT.

For the simulations, the exact conduit cross section, the particle-size distribution of the packing material, and the respective average interparticle porosity (packing density) of the HPLC-microchip packings was reconstructed. Large-scale simulation of flow and transport at Peclet numbers of up to Pe = 140 in the reconstructed microchip packings (containing more than 3 *10\^{}5 spheres) was facilitated by the efficient use of supercomputer power. Porosity distributions and fluid flow velocity profiles for the reconstructed microchip packings are presented and analyzed. Aberrations from regular geometrical conduit shape are shown to influence packing structure and, thus, porosity and velocity distributions. Simulated axial dispersion coefficients are discussed with respect to their dependence on flow velocity and bed porosity. It is shown by comparison to experimental separation efficiencies that the simulated data genuinely reflect the general dispersion behavior of the real-life HPLC-microchip packings. Differences between experiment and simulation are explained by differing morphologies of real and simulated packings (intraparticle porosity, packing structure in the corner regions).},

The applied simulation method takes into account the velocity of the slurry and colloidal interaction forces, as well as inter-particle hydrodynamic interactions. The predicted bed porosities suggest that a lower slurry velocity leads to a denser packing structure due to the increased effect of colloidal repulsion effects. The results of the simulations were compared with the external porosity and chromatographic performance of capillary LC columns that were packed at different filtration and compaction pressures. However, the trends that were observed in the experimental results suggest that hydrodynamic packing parameters have no or little effect on the chromatographic performance of capillary LC columns. Within the experimental parameter window, the chromatographic performance and the column porosity were not influenced by the filtration and compaction pressure, nor by the duration of the compaction process.},

abstract = {The creation of a 3D pore-scale model of a porous medium is often an essential step in quantitatively characterising the medium and predicting its transport properties. Here we describe a new stochastic pore space reconstruction approach that uses thin section images as its main input. The approach involves using a third-order Markov mesh where we introduce a new algorithm that creates the reconstruction in a single scan, thus overcoming the computational issues normally associated with Markov chain methods. The technique is capable of generating realistic pore architecture models (PAMs), and examples are presented for a range of fairly homogenous rock samples as well as for one heterogeneous soil sample. We then apply a Lattice\^{a}€“Boltzmann (LB) scheme to calculate the permeabilities of the PAMs, which in all cases closely match the measured values of the original samples. We also develop a set of software methods \^{a}€“ referred to as pore analysis tools (PATs) \^{a}€“ to quantitatively analyse the reconstructed pore systems. These tools reveal the pore connectivity and pore size distribution, from which we can simulate the mercury injection process, which in turn reproduces the measured curves very closely. Analysis of the topological descriptors reveals that a connectivity function based on the specific Euler number may serve as a simple predictor of the threshold pressure for geo-materials.},

abstract = {A dream of many pharmaceutical companies is to be able to register a large design space with the regulatory agencies. The problem is that this will require both time and money, so an intelligent method of validating a design space is needed. The design space should only cover operating points at which the process runs optimally. This means that the process should be optimized for different process scenarios and objective functions and the found operating points should be registered as design space. This paper presents a method of determining a good design space by creating Pareto fronts for the ideal case and for various process disturbance scenarios. Optimal operating points are found for varying ratios between feed costs and operating costs, making it possible to make a quantitative choice of an operating point based on this ratio and a qualitative choice based on the whole front. The analysis will show how the chromatographic process can be made more robust when optimizing for higher yields, and how the effect of the critical process parameters can change. To be certain that a robust process is found and that it has a high performance, process disturbances must be taken into account when optimizing a process.},

First, parameters of the physical model through experiments are determined, and then the physical model is used to estimate initial parameters of the nonlinear empirical model (Hammerstein) using orthogonal forward regression. Parameters of the nonlinear empirical model are updated at the end of each run using a nonlinear recursive parameter estimation method. The updated empirical model is then used in the control algorithm (model predictive control) to estimate operating conditions for the next batch. Processes operating under fixed optimal conditions are compared with those operating with GR2R control for both gradient and displacement chromatography. The GR2R outperforms the fixed conditions in the presence of various disturbances (such as bed capacity, column efficiency, and feed load) and is an effective strategy for the optimization and control of complex chromatographic processes.},

abstract = {An experimental protocol is proposed in order to measure with accuracy and precision the band compression factor of a protein in gradient RPLC. Extra-column contributions to bandwidth and the dependency of both the retention factor and the reduced height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) on the mobile phase composition were taken into account. The band compression factor of a small protein (insulin, MW kDa) was measured on a mm column packed with 1.7 m C4-bonded bridged ethylsiloxane BEH-silica particles, for 1 L samples of dilute insulin solution (<0.05 g/L). A linear gradient profile of acetonitrile (25-28\% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1\% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied during three different gradient times (5, 12.5, and 20 min). The mobile phase flow rate was set at 0.20 mL/min in order to avoid heat friction effects (maximum column inlet pressure 180 bar). The band compression factor of insulin is defined as the ratio of the experimental space band variance measured under gradient conditions to the reference space band variance, which would be observed if no thermodynamic compression would take place during gradient elution. It was 0.56, 0.71, and 0.76 with gradient times of 5, 12.5, and 20 min, respectively. These factors are 20-30\% smaller than the theoretical band compression factors (0.79, 0.89, and 0.93) calculated from an equation derived from the well-known Poppe equation, later extended to any retention models and columns whose HETP depends on the mobile phase composition. This difference is explained in part by the omission in the model of the effect of the pressure gradient on the local retention factor of insulin during gradient elution. A much better agreement is obtained for insulin when this effect is taken into account. For lower molecular weight compounds, the pressure gradient has little effect but the finite retention of acetonitrile causes a distortion of the gradient shape during the migration of its breakthrough front along the column. This phenomenon should be taken into account in the theoretical models.},

abstract = {The influences of the errors made in the measurement of the extra-column volume of an instrument on the accuracies of the estimates made of the column efficiency and of the parameters of the mass transfer kinetics were investigated from an experimental point of view. A standard HP1090 apparatus (extra-column volume, [approximate] 50[thin space] L) was used to measure the efficiency of a Sunfire-C18 RPLC column (column hold-up volume, [approximate] 1.50[thin space]mL). The first and second moments of the peaks of phenol (a retained compound) and of thiourea (a practically non-retained compound) were measured at six different temperatures between 22 and 78[thin space]°C, for flow rates between 0.10 and 4.70[thin space]mL/min (i.e., for linear velocities between 0.025 and 1.179[thin space]cm/s). Each series of measurements was successively made with the instrument being fitted with and without the column. The experimental HETP data must be corrected for the solute dispersion in the connected tubes in order properly to assess the true column efficiency. Even with a modern, high performance instrument, the dispersion of a non-retained compound is essentially due to the band broadening phenomena that take place in the extra-column volumes, the sum of all these extra-column band broadening contributions accounting for more than 80\% of the total band broadening measured. The contribution of the sampling device is particularly deleterious since, for a 2[thin space] L injection, the maximum solute concentration in the peak that enters into the column is nearly ten-fold lower than that of the sample. Nevertheless, the impact of the extra-column volumes on the estimates of the kinetic parameters (e.g., molecular diffusion coefficient Dm and effective particle diffusivity De) remains negligible. Obviously, the relative error made on the column efficiency of a retained compound depends much on its retention factor. It decreases from 8 to 1\% when the retention factor increases from 5 to 17.},

abstract = {In protein chromatography large molecules have to diffuse into the stationary phase.

In this study three different prepacked columns, with different bead sizes, are used for the separation of IgG and BSA to confirm or reject this assumption in an ion-exchange application. The separations are modeled and calibrated against gradient elution data. Model calibration of reaction-dispersive, transport-dispersive and general rate model structures are discussed and the analysis shows that the columns are best modeled by different model structures, because different behaviors are rate-limiting. Experiments can be described surprisingly well by reaction-dispersive model structures, especially for BSA. Broad elution peaks for IgG indicate mass transfer limitations. Calibration of models capturing diffusive effects shows that the pore diffusion coefficients are much higher than expected, compared with the literature, indicating that there are other forces dominating the mass transport in the beads.},

abstract = {In this article, a systematic approach is presented which allows the estimation of model parameters including isotherm parameters for equilibrium-dispersive and general rate models including a procedure for how to subsequently select the most appropriate isotherm and model for a given application. The approach consists of three parts: determination of feed concentration, parameter estimation, and model selection. Accurate modeling of any separation process depends on the starting point, i.e. the feed and the feed concentration, however, for many chromatographic separations, this concentration is unknown. The first part of this work therefore presents a systematic procedure for feed concentration determination. The estimation of isotherm or other model parameters is done using the simulation and optimization tool gPROMS. Finally, the predictions from each model alternative are then compared using fractionation and maximum purification diagrams. The estimation approach is successfully applied to three case studies, including purification of alcohol dehydrogenase from a yeast homogenate supernatant and gradient elution ion-exchange of myoglobin, which illustrate the approach and the relative suitability and range of application of the models in describing the behavior of complex chromatographic separations. It is found that, while the equilibrium-dispersive model is a good approximation in most cases, there are cases when the more detailed general rate model is required. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2008},

abstract = {The complex pattern of viscous fingering (VF) appears to be chaotic. Its early evolution seems predictable but, on a long time-scale, it is not so and the transition is complex. Detailed experimental observations of fingering systems have been hindered by various limitations. We present a new method for visualising VF in particulate beds. Our results show that the onset of VF and its initial evolution are reasonably reproducible at very low Reynolds numbers (Re < 0.005). The transition to irreproducibility of the fingering pattern develops progressively over long migration distances. When the flow velocity increases, changes in the finger distribution take place over shorter migration distances, become more important, and the fingers evolve faster. Understanding this new aspect might allow improvements in the efficiency of processes governed by VF, e.g. injection of large, concentrated samples or transfer of large fractions between two streams having different viscosities.},

abstract = {A method using a model-based approach to design and optimize an ion-exchange step in a protein purification process is proposed for the separation of IgG from a mixture containing IgG, BSA and myoglobin. The method consists of three steps. In the first step, the model is calibrated against carefully designed experiments. The chromatographic model describes the convective and dispersive flow in the column, the diffusion in the adsorbent particles, and the protein adsorption using Langmuir kinetics with mobile phase modulators (MPM). In the second step, the model is validated against a validation experiment and analyzed. In the third and final step, the operating conditions are optimized. In the optimization step, the loading volume and the elution gradient are optimized with regard to the most important costs: the fixed costs and the feed cost. The optimization is achieved by maximizing the objective functions productivity (i.e. the production rate for a given amount of stationary phase) and product yield (i.e. the fraction of IgG recovered in the product stream). All optimization is conducted under the constraint of 99\% purity of the IgG. The model calibration and the analysis show that this purification step is determined mainly by the kinetics, although as large a protein as IgG is used in the study. The two different optima resulting from this study are a productivity of 2.7 g IgG/(s m3) stationary phase and a yield of 90\%. This model-based approach also gives information of the robustness of the chosen operating conditions. It is shown that the bead diameter could only be increased from 15 [mu]m to 35 [mu]m with maximum productivity and a 99\% purity constraint due to increased diffusion hindrance in larger beads.},

In addition to common fluid phase measurements, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was applied to evaluate the respective intraparticle concentration profiles. In order to ensure that the observed intraparticle protein distributions are not disturbed by artefacts of CLSM, microscopic data are carefully analysed considering signal attenuation and competitive adsorption between labelled and native species. Using this setup, lower protein concentration in the inner particle region was observed even after long equilibration times in protein solution. Since the observed phenomenon showed a dependency on the amount of adsorbed protein, we assumed that the intraparticle diffusion was hindered by the adsorbed protein molecules. We propose hypotheses on the diffusion hindrance, and compare the experimental results with model-based simulations of single particles that include novel terms for the description of hindered diffusion.},

The chip was fabricated by laminating polyimide films with laser-ablated channels, ports, and frit structures. The enrichment and separation columns were packed using conventional reversed-phase chromatography particles. A face-seal rotary valve provided a means for switching between sample loading and separation configurations with minimum dead and delay volumes while allowing high-pressure operation. The LC chip and valve assembly were mounted within a custom electrospray source on an ion-trap mass spectrometer. The overall system performance was demonstrated through reversed-phase gradient separations of tryptic protein digests at flow rates between 100 and 400 nL/min. Microfluidic integration of the nano-LC components enabled separations with subfemtomole detection sensitivity, minimal carryover, and robust and stable electrospray throughout the LC solvent gradient.},

abstract = {Randomly packed fixed-bed reactors are widely used in the chemical process industries. Their design is usually based on pseudo-homogeneous model equations with averaged semi-empirical parameters. However, this design concept fails for low tube-to-particle diameter ratios (=aspect ratios) where local phenomena dominate. The complete three-dimensional (3D) structure of the packing has therefore to be considered in order to resolve the local inhomogeneities. New numerical methods and the increase of computational power allow us to simulate in detail single phase reacting flows in such reactors, exclusively based on material properties and the 3D description of the geometry, thus without the use of semi-empirical data. The successive simulation steps (packing generation, fluid flow and species calculation) and their validation with experimental data are described in this paper. In order to synthetically generate realistic random packings of spherical particles, we apply a Monte-Carlo method. The subsequent numerical simulation of the 3D flow field and coupled mass transport of reacting species is done by means of lattice Boltzmann methods. The simulation results reveal that not only the local behaviour but also integral quantities like the pressure drop depend remarkably on the local structural properties of the packings, a feature which is neglected when using correlations with averaged values.},

abstract = {The effect of salt on the retention behavior of proteins in electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction chromatography is described by a three-parameter equation, log k' = A - B log ms + Cms, where k' is the retention factor and ms is the molality of the salt in the eluent. Parameter B, termed the electrostatic interaction parameter, depends on the characteristic charge of the protein and the salt counterion and governs the change of retention with the salt concentration in ion-exchange chromatography. According to the model the magnitude of the hydrophobic interaction parameter C is determined by the hydrophobic contact area upon protein binding at the stationary phase surface and the properties of the salt as measured by its molal surface tension increment. Retention data measured at different salt concentrations in the eluent on a variety of ion exchangers can be fitted to the above equation which yields U-shaped plots of log k' against log ms. The limiting slopes of the appropriate plots at sufficiently low and high salt concentrations can be used to evaluate the electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction parameters, respectively. The approach, which is based on a combination of established treatments of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions offers a convenient framework for analyzing retention data in biopolymer high-performance liquid chromatography and for the characterization of stationary phases. Furthermore, it may facilitate some characterization of protein molecules on the basis of their retention behavior as a function of the concentration and nature of the salt in the eluent. In the treatment of electrostatic interactions use is made of the counterion condensation theory that is believed to make possible a more comprehensive analysis than the traditional stoichiometric ion-exchange model which assumes binding of the proteins by coulombic interactions at discrete sites. The treatment of hydrophobic interactions is based on an adaptation of the solvophobic theory which predicts that the hydrophobic portion of the free energy of binding is proportional to the hydrophobic contact area and the microthermodynamic surface tension of the aqueous salt solution. Despite its simplicity the theory was successful in explaining the observed effect of the nature and concentration of salt in the eluent, the pH and the effect of the density of fixed charges at the surface of the stationary phase in the absence of specific salt effects.},

In the first application, SDC was used as a prefractionation method prior to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) to separate a human prostate cancer cell lysate. It was observed that the resolution achieved in narrow-pI-range 2D-PAGE was improved when using SDC prefractionation, so that SDC may be useful as a low-cost, high-speed, and highly scalable alternative to electrophoretic prefractionation methods for 2D-PAGE. The second application involves the use of SDC as the first dimension, and reversed-phase chromatography as the second dimension, to produce a novel, fully automated, two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography technique. The method was shown to have performance advantages over one-dimensional reversed-phase chromatography for peptide separations.},

The bands were photographed on-column with two standard 35-mm SLR cameras oriented at right angle. The photographs were scanned and the digitized images of the sample bands analyzed with proper software. A number of columns, as similar as possible, were fitted with different 2- and 10-[mu]m porosity stainless steel frits. Subsequent analysis of the digitized band images revealed irregularities in the band shape resulting from frit contributions to band dispersion. The 2-[mu]m frits produced more dramatic effects overall than the coarser frits. Local axial dispersion coefficient values, expressed as local reduced plate height, were calculated. The results demonstrate the possibly damaging effects of the frit on the band shape.},

An important aspect in all studies is the understanding of the binding mechanism between protein and resin on a molecular level in order to optimize processes on the level of adsorber design. We established a method to determine the binding orientation of lysozyme for different materials under various experimental conditions enabling us to observe changes in the mode of adsorption. We varied the protein load of two different adsorber types, Source 15 S, a conventional cation exchange resin and EMD Fractogel SO3, a tentacle-type cation exchanger. We found similar preferential binding sites for the interaction between lysozyme and the surface of these adsorbers at low surface coverage, however, the tentacle adsorber exhibited multi-point binding whereas the binding on Source was limited to one binding site only. With increasing protein density on the surface, lysozyme rotates from a space-consuming side-on to a space-saving end-on orientation on Fractogel, explaining a higher maximum binding capacity for Fractogel.

@article{Gzil.etal04JoC,
abstract = {The chromatographic performance of several straightforward two-dimensional etched packed bed column lay-outs (equilaterally staggered arrays of, respectively, circular, hexagonal, and diamond-like pillars) has been compared using commercial computational fluid dynamics software. In all cases, the bed porosity was kept at [var epsilon]=0.4 and a retained component with zone capacity ratio k''=2 was considered. Exploring the use of six different possible characteristic dimensions to bring the Van Deemter plots of the three different considered particle shapes into agreement, none of them yielded a perfect agreement. Using the pillar volume-based equivalent cylinder diameter (deq) as the characteristic dimension, the diamond-like pillars yielded a significantly smaller hmin value than the cylinders and the hexagons (hmin[congruent with]0.74 for the former versus hmin[congruent with]0.83 for the two latter). Including the flow resistance into the analysis, it was found that the "hydrodynamic" shape of the particles has an important influence on the separation impedance E. The more axially elongated diamond pillars yielded an Emin number as small Emin=180 (for a retained component with k''=2), i.e. about 40\% smaller than the cylinders and the hexagons (Emin=300-330). The obtained hmin and Emin values are also significantly smaller than the values often cited for the best possible packed bed HPLC columns. We believe this is a consequence of the assumed perfect homogeneity of the etched structures, and hence hints at the potential benefits of perfectly ordered chromatographic columns, as was already inferred by Knox [J. Chromatogr. A 831 (1999) 3; 960 (2002) 7] and He et al. [Anal. Chem. 70 (1998) 3790].},

abstract = {A comparative study has been undertaken on various strong anion-exchangers to investigate the pH dependence, titration curves, efficiency, binding strength, and dynamic capacity of the chromatographic resins. The resins tested included: Macro-Prep 25Q, TSK-Gel Q-5PW-HR, Poros QE/M, Q Sepharose FF, Q HyperD 20, Q Zirconia, Source 30Q, Fractogel EMD TMAE 650s, and Express-Ion Q. Testing was performed with five different proteins: Anti-FVII Mab (IgG), aprotinin, BSA, lipolase, and myoglobin. The dependence of pH on retention varies from generally low to very high for proteins with low pI. No direct link between pH dependence on retention and titration curves of the different resins was observed. Efficiency results show the expected trend of lower dependence of the plate height with increasing flow-rate of resins for medium and high pressure operation compared to the soft resins. Binding to the anion-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength may vary depending on the specific protein. Generally, binding and elution at a high salt concentration may be performed with Poros QE/M or Macro-Prep 25Q, while binding and elution at low salt concentration may be done with TSK-Gel Q-5PW. Dynamic capacities are strongly dependent on the specific protein employed and for some resins dependent on the flow-rate. A general good agreement was obtained between this study and data obtained by suppliers for the dynamic capacity. The results of this study may be used for selection of resins for testing in process development, however, the data does not tell anything about specific selectivity differences or resolution between a target protein and a given impurity. None of the resins studied here should be regarded as good or bad, but more or less suitable for a specific purpose, and only testing for the specific application will determine which one is the optimal resin.},

It is found that the performance of the small porosity systems is very sensitive to the exact pillar shape, whereas this difference gradually disappears with increasing porosity. The obtained separation impedances are very small in comparison to packed bed and monolithic columns and decrease with increasing porosity. If accounting for the current micromachining limitations, a proper selection of the exact shape and porosity even becomes more critical, and different design rules are obtained depending on whether porous or non-porous pillars are considered.},

@article{Dutta.Leighton01AC,
abstract = {Fluid is often moved about microetched channels in lab-on-a-chip applications using electrokinetic flows (electrophoresis or electroosmosis) rather than pressure-driven flows because the latter result in large Taylor dispersion. However, small pressure gradients may arise unintentionally in such systems due to a mismatch in electroosmotic flow rates or hydrostatic pressure differentials along the microetched channel. Under laminar flow conditions, Doshi et al. (Chem. Eng. Sci. 1978, 33, 795804) have shown that for a channel with rectangular cross-section of width W and depth d, longitudinal diffusivities can attain values as large as 8 K0 for small values of the aspect ratio d/W, where K0 is the value of the longitudinal diffusivity obtained by ignoring all variations across the channel. Microchannels in lab-on-a-chip geometries are often not rectangular in cross-section. Isotropic etching techniques, for example, lead to channels with quarter-circular ends. In this paper we examine the effect of this geometry on the magnitude of longitudinal dispersivity for pressure-driven flows and also investigate modifications to this design which may minimize such dispersion. Optimal channel profiles are shown to lead to dispersivities approaching K0, the theoretical minimum, for small values of d/W.},

Surprisingly, process development is often still based on empirical studies or experience; recently high-throughput screening stations are employed to minimize development time and to improve screening quality. Still, experimental effort remains high and a more detailed understanding of adsorption mechanisms on a molecular level underlying chromatographic separation could help in the future to select and design chromatography steps in silico. In this study, we focused on the elucidation of protein orientation upon adsorption onto a chromatographic resin. We identified two characteristic binding sites of lysozyme on SP Sepharose Fast Flow and one multipoint interaction of lysozyme with SP Sepharose XL. Increasing ionic strength did not significantly influence the binding, whereas changes in the mobile phase pH led to a re-orientation on SP Sepharose FF. This phenomenon agrees well with theoretical considerations, including a detailed description of the surface charge distribution with changing pH and linear elution experiments, giving an idea why proteins are often retained on ion-exchange materials beyond their isoelectric point.},

abstract = {Using optical on-column visualization for the study of the migration of sample bands, the radial variations of the local migration rate were studied in the region near the column wall. Photographs of small sample bands migrating along the column at various radial locations were obtained. On-column chromatograms extracted from these photographs showed evidence of two wall effects. The first of these effects was present only within the immediate vicinity of the wall. It is a direct result of the inability of the packing material to form a close packed configuration against the rigid column wall surface. The second wall effect causes a systematic variation of the migration rate of the sample band in the region of the wall, this rate increasing from the wall to the central region of the column. The corresponding images portrayed the classical "wall effect" that chromatographers have long discussed. They also show that this effect extends further into the column than anticipated. As to what are the relative contributions to the results of our observations of the wall effect and of a frit effect discussed in previous publications, this could not be ascertained.},

Such an integration of reaction and separation in one unit operation is advantageous for the equilibrium limited glucose isomerization. However, it complicates process design and process control. The continuous operating parameters and the discrete distribution of the columns over the different zones of the RSMB process are determined using a rigorous model-based optimization strategy. In order to maintain the product purity in the presence of disturbances while injecting a minimal additional amount of eluent, a nonlinear model predictive controller was developed which can deal with the complex hybrid (continuous/discrete) dynamics of the RSMB plant and takes hard process constraints (e.g. the maximal allowable pressure drop) into account. The efficiency of the control concept is proven in experimental studies using a 6-column RSMB plant of pharmaceutical scale.},

The parameters in the models are easy to determine and have a well-defined physical significance.

Two conditions were tested: (1) the mobile phase viscosity was less than the injection plug viscosity, and (2) the mobile phase viscosity was greater than the injection plug viscosity. Under the first condition, retention time and elution performance decreased as the viscosity contrast between the mobile phase and injection plug increased. The effect on performance was more marked as the injection volume increased. A decrease in performance of 12\% for compounds with retention factors up to 2.8 was apparent even when the viscosity contrast was only 0.165 cP. In the second set of conditions, elution performance was actually observed to increase, by as much as 25\% for a 40 [mu]L injection, as the viscosity contrast between the mobile phase and the solute plug increased. No change in the retention factor was observed. This behaviour was attributed to the shape of an injection plug as it enters into the column, whereby a low viscosity plug permeates away from the wall when the column contains a higher viscosity mobile phase, and vice a versa for a high viscosity plug entering a low viscosity mobile phase. At no stage was either a band splitting or shoulders observed with viscosity contrasts up to 1.283 cP, as could have been expected.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to gain process knowledge and assist in the robustness analysis of an ion-exchange step in a protein purification process using a model-based approach. Factorial experimental design is common practice in industry today to obtain robustness characterization of unit operations with respect to variations in process parameters. This work aims at providing a better insight into what process variations affect quality and to further reduce the experimental work to the regions of process variation that are of most interest. This methodology also greatly increases the ability to predict process performance and promotes process understanding. The model calibration part of the methodology involves three consecutive steps to calibrate a steric mass action (SMA) ion-exchange chromatography model. Firstly, a number of gradient elution experiments are performed. Secondly, experimental breakthrough curves have to be generated for the proteins if the adsorption capacity of the medium for each component is not known. Thirdly, a multi-component loading experiment is performed to calibrate the multi-component effects that cannot be determined from the single-component experiments. The separation process studied in this work is the separation of polyclonal IgG from a mixture containing IgG, myoglobin and BSA. The calibrated model is used to simulate six process variations in a full factorial experiment. The results of the simulations provide information about the importance of the different process variations and the simulations are also used to determine the crucial points for the process parameter variations. The methodology can be used to assist in the robustness analysis normally performed in the pharmaceutical industry today as it is able to predict the impact on process performance resulting from variations in salt concentration, column load, protein concentration and flow rate.},

We present lateral porosity and velocity distributions for all packings and monitor the time evolution of longitudinal dispersion up to the asymptotic (long-time) limit. The characteristic length scales for asymptotic behaviour are explained from the symmetry of each conduit's velocity field.

abstract = {Affinity chromatography uses biospecific binding usually between an antibody and an antigen, an enzyme and a substrate or other pairs of key-lock type of matching molecules. Due to its high selectivity, it is able to purify proteins and other macromolecules from very dilute solutions. In this work, a general rate model for affinity chromatography was used for scale-up studies. Parameters for the model were estimated from existing correlations, or from experimental results obtained on a small column with the same packing material. As an example, Affi-Gel with 4.5 [mu]mol cm-3 Cibacron Blue F-3GA as immobilized ligands covalently attached to cross-linked 6\% agarose was used for column packing. Cibacron Blue F-3GA was also used as a soluble ligand in the elution stage. Two separate cases were studied. One involved a bovine serum albumin solution, and the other hen egg white lysozyme solution. Satisfactory scale-up predictions were obtained for a 98.2 ml column and a 501 ml column based on a few experimental data obtained on a 7.85 ml small column.},

abstract = {A method for estimation of unknown adsorption parameters in a detailed chromatography model including the Langmuir adsorption expression is proposed. The model describes the concentration of the solute in the mobile phase and considers external/internal mass transfer resistance and adsorption dynamics. The external volume and its mixing effect are also considered. The unknown model parameters estimated are the bed void, the axial dispersion coefficient, the liquid film mass transfer coefficient, the effective diffusion coefficient, the apparent bead porosity, the adsorption/desorption rate coefficients and the Langmuir isotherm. All the parameters in the model were subsequently determined in four classes of experiments, the external mixing behaviour, the mobile phase behaviour, the stationary phase behaviour and the adsorption behaviour. The estimates are based on the sum of the least squares of the residuals between the experimental breakthrough curves and the model response. The methodology is exemplified by frontal experiments with bovine serum albumin in a shallow packed bed. The results show that it is possible to estimate the adsorption parameters using the proposed methodology, and to replace the Langmuir adsorption dynamic expression with the corresponding isotherm when high inlet concentrations are used. It was also investigated at what inlet concentration this model simplification resulted in satisfactory results. It was possible to estimate adsorption parameters using several experimental breakthrough curves simultaneously, i.e. multiple data responses, to obtain single parameters that are valid within the interval of inlet concentrations used.},

@article{Billen.Desmet07JoCA,
abstract = {The present contribution reviews the use of alternative support formats as a means to surpass the chromatographic performance of the packed bed of spheres. First, a number of idealized structures are considered to obtain a general insight in how the performance of a chromatographic support depends on its shape and size, using the isocratic peak-capacity generation speed as the main performance indicator. Using this criterion, it is found that the packing density or, equivalently, the external porosity, is the most important of all geometrical shape factors. Depending on whether the sample consists of weakly or strongly retained components, the optimal external porosity can be expected to vary between 60\% and a value near 100\%. The optimal exploitation of a high external porosity, however, also requires overall shrinkage of the domain size, towards and into the sub-micron range. With the current fabrication technologies, this requirement seems difficult to achieve. In the presence of a lower limit on the characteristic support size, each range of desired plate numbers or peak capacities has its own optimal external porosity, ranging from a very low value (high packing density) for high speed, small peak capacity applications, to very high external porosities (low packing density) for applications requiring a very large peak capacity. Subsequently, the obtained theoretical insights are used to review and discuss the past and current research on alternative support formats. Finally, a number of emerging micro- and nano-fabrication technologies are introduced and their potential for the future production of supports with improved shape and homogeneity is discussed.},

abstract = {A large group of separation problems can be solved using selective adsorption on suitable solids. A mathematical description of adsorption isotherms, which relate the equilibrium concentrations in the fluid phase to the loadings of the solid, could be used to design, observe and control such processes in an efficient way. However, the determination of the isotherms typically requires the identification of unknown parameters in postulated models from experimental data. While for the estimation of the parameters a number of tools and methods are available, a comprehensive analysis of the quality of the parameters is seldom performed. To estimate and characterize parameters obtained from adsorption measurements in this work a non-linear regression analysis was explored in combination with an extended statistical analysis. Hereby, the non-linearity method ("intrinsic" and "parameter-effect" non-linearity) proposed by Bates and Watts [1980. Relative curvature measures of non-linearity. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological) 42, 1-25] was used to check the quality of parameters and the suitability of model/data combinations. The variances of the parameters are determined with the bootstrap method originally proposed by Efron and Tibshirani [1993. An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Chapman and Hall, CRC Press, London, Boca Raton.]. The later approach clearly overcomes some limitation of classical Fisher-information-matrix (FIM) method. By applying these statistical methods to different adsorption models and data sets, it was found that non-linearity method is a good tool to check the quality of the model/data combination. Furthermore, it was found that the confidence intervals of the parameters determined based on the bootstrap are larger than predicted by traditional methods.},

Chromatographic conditions followed protocols used in industrial antibody processing, including stripping and cleaning-in-place of the resins. For all three media, no significant loss of purification performance (measured by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)) could be observed over 50 cycles. Eluate samples were analyzed for leaked protein A and host cell protein (HCP) content. MabSelect SuRe, the first protein A affinity medium compatible with alkaline regeneration conditions, exhibited the lowest leakage levels, in the range of 1-3 ppm. For the media MabSelect Xtra and ProSep-vA Ultra, leakage levels were in the range of 30-40 ppm.

The method presented in this study can be used to find the critical parameter variations and serve as a basis for reducing the experimental work. In addition, the calibrated model obtained with this approach is used to find the optimal operating conditions for the chromatography column. The methodology consists of three consecutive steps. Firstly, screening experiments are performed using a factorial design. Secondly, a kinetic-dispersive model is calibrated using gradient elution and column load experiments. Finally, the model is used to find optimal operating conditions and a robustness analysis is conducted at the optimal point.

The onset of viscous fingering was visually observed by packing a glass column with particles having the same refractive index as the mobile phase and injecting plugs of dye solutions having viscosities different from that of the mobile phase. Severe fingering effects are observed if the viscosity difference exceeds 0.17 cP. However, for smaller viscosity differences, band distortions are observed that may affect retention data, band efficiency, and band resolution. Careful attention should be paid to matching the mobile phase viscosity and that of the injection plug when accurate chromatographic information is required.},

The suggested method has capability to capture sharp discontinuities and narrow peaks of the elution profiles. The accuracy of the method can be improved by introducing additional nodes in the same solution element and, hence, avoids the expansion of mesh stencils normally encountered in the high order finite volume schemes. Thus, the method can be uniformly applied up to boundary cells without loosing accuracy. The method is robust and well suited for large-scale time-dependent simulations of chromatographic processes where accuracy is highly demanding. Several test problems of isothermal non-reactive and reactive chromatographic processes are presented. The results of the current method are validated against flux-limiting finite volume schemes. The numerical results verify the efficiency and accuracy of the investigated method. The proposed scheme gives more resolved solutions than the high resolution finite volume schemes.},

abstract = {Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is a widely used tool in bioseparations. Because its separation mechanism is based on the permeability of macromolecules rather than any type of binding, the feed volume to bed volume ratio is usually quite small. Thus, large columns are typically used in preparative- and large scale separations. In this work, a general rate model considering various mass transfer effects was successfully used for the scale-up predictions of preparative SEC columns. The effects of various physical parameters on the performance of SEC were investigated using computer simulation based on the model. A method was developed to scale up SEC columns based on a few simple elution runs on a small column with the same packing to be used in the larger column using a personal computer based simulation software program. Existing correlations in the literature were used to estimate some mass transfer coefficients in the general rate model. The elution peaks for a large column could be predicted a priori using the method which was tested experimentally in this work. It very accurately predicted the retention times and peak shapes of myoglobin and ovalbumin eluted from three preparative SEC glass columns packed with P60 gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The bed dimensions were 4.4 cm(i.d.)×29.5 cm, 5.0 cm×29.5 cm, and 5.0 cm×42.0 cm, respectively. The small column used for the scale-up prediction had bed dimensions of 1.5 cm×27.3 cm.},

abstract = {The chromatographic performance with respect to the flow behavior and dispersion in fixed beds of nonporous and macroporous particles (having mean intraparticle pore diameters of 41, 105, and 232 nm) has been studied in capillary HPLC and electrochromatography. The existence of substantial electroosmotic intraparticle pore flow (perfusive electroosmosis) in columns packed with the macroporous particles was found to reduce stagnant mobile mass transfer resistance and decrease the global flow inhomogeneity over the column cross-section, leading to a significant improvement in column efficiency compared to capillary HPLC. The effect of electroosmotic perfusion on axial dispersion was shown to be sensitive to the mobile phase ionic strength and mean intraparticle pore diameter, thus, on an electrical double layer interaction within the particles. Complementary and consistent results were observed for the average electroosmotic flow through packed capillaries. It was found to depend on particle porosity and distinct contributions to the electrical double layer behavior within and between particles. Based on these data an optimum chromatographic performance in view of speed and efficiency can be achieved by straightforward adjustment of the electrolyte concentration and characteristic intraparticle pore size.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in extending the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to model transport phenomena in the non-continuum regime. Most of these studies have focused on single-component flows through simple geometries. This work examines an ad hoc extension of a recently developed LBM model for multi-component mass diffusion (Joshi et al 2007 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 40 2961) to model mass diffusion in the non-continuum regime. In order to validate the method, LBM results for ternary diffusion in a two-dimensional channel are compared with predictions of the dusty gas model (DGM) over a range of Knudsen numbers. A calibration factor based on the DGM is used in the LBM to correlate Knudsen diffusivity to pore size. Results indicate that the LBM can be a useful tool for predicting non-continuum mass diffusion (Kn \&gt; 0.001), but additional research is needed to extend the range of applicability of the algorithm for a larger parameter space. Guidelines are given on using the methodology described in this work to model non-continuum mass transport in more complex geometries where the DGM is not easily applicable. In addition, the non-continuum LBM methodology can be extended to three-dimensions. An envisioned application of this technique is to model non-continuum mass transport in porous solid oxide fuel cell electrodes.},

abstract = {New experimental data of the viscous fingering (VF) process have been generated by studying the VF process in perfectly ordered pillar array columns instead of in the traditionally employed packed bed columns. A detailed quantitative analysis of the contribution of VF to the observed band broadening could be made by following the injected species bands using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD-camera. For a viscosity contrast of 0.16 cP, a plate height increase of about 1 [mu]m can be observed, while for a contrast of respectively 0.5 cP and 1 cP, additional plate height contributions of the order of 5-20 [mu]m were observed. Citing these values is however futile without noting that they also depend extremely strongly on the injection volume of injected sample. It was found that, for a given viscosity contrast of 0.314 cP, the maximal plate height increase varied between 0.5 [mu]m and 18 [mu]m if the injection volume was varied between 3.0 nl and 32.7 nl. These values furthermore also strongly vary with the distance along the column axis.},

abstract = {Random packings of 2000 rigid disks in the plane, subject to periodic boundary conditions on a square primitive cell, have been generated by a concurrent construction which treats all disks on an equal footing, as opposed to previously investigated sequential constructions. The particles start with random positions and velocities, and as they move about they grow uniformly in size, from points to jammed disks. The collection of packings displays several striking geometric features. These include (for largeN) typically polycrystalline textures with irregular grain boundaries and linear shear fractures. The packings occasionally contain monovacancies and trapped but unjammed matter disks. The latter appear to be confined to the grain boundaries. The linear shear fractures preserve bond orientational order, but disrupt translational order, within the crystalline grains. A new efficient event-driven simulation algorithm is employed to generate the histories of colliding and jamming disks. On a computer which can process one million floating-point instructions per second the algorithm processes more than one million pairwise collisions per hour.},

abstract = {Time and length scales as well as the magnitude of individual contributions to eddy dispersion in chromatographic beds are resolved. We address this issue by a high-resolution numerical analysis of flow and mass transport in computer-generated bulk (unconfined) packings of monosized, nonporous, incompressible, spherical particles and complementary confined cylindrical packings with a cylinder-to-particle diameter ratio of dc/dp = 20. The transient behavior of longitudinal and transverse dispersion is analyzed and correlated with the spatial scales of heterogeneity in the bulk and confined packings. Simulations were carried out until complete transcolumn equilibration in the confined packings was achieved to facilitate a quantitative study of the geometrical wall effect. Longitudinal plate height data calculated over a wide range of reduced velocities were fitted to the comprehensive Giddings equation. The determined transition velocities for individual contributions to eddy dispersion were found to be widely disparate. As a consequence, the total effect of eddy dispersion on the plate height curves can be approximated in the practical range of chromatographic operational velocities by a composite expression in which only the short-range interchannel contribution retains its coupling characteristics, while transchannel and transcolumn contributions appear as simple mass transfer velocity-proportional terms.},

abstract = {Summary Some system factors like poor packing, distribution system and viscous heat dissipation may result in the core of a solute concentration band goes faster, forming a parabolic concentration band and reducing column efficiency. Feed temperature control method, which is to appropriately control eluent at the column inlet at a temperature lower than the wall temperature, can modify the band shape and counteract such negative effects. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT, the present work investigated the effect of a variety of system factors on the temperature distribution in a chromatographic column and the optimal temperature difference between the inlet and the column wall in feed temperature control, ? T opt. It was found that the factors affecting flow distribution have no significant effect on temperature distribution but significantly affect ? T opt. The factors strongly related to temperature distribution might not interfere with ? T opt. The reason is that the principle of feed temperature control is to reshape the solute concentration band, which depends on flow distribution. This work also found that for a given column and a given eluent, ? T opt was independent of the Reynolds No and Peclet No derived from component balance ? T opt depends on Peclet No derived from energy balance, but the correlation between them is uncertain due to the unclear effect of ? eff on ? T opt.},

Because of the flat nature of protein titration curves from pH \~{}6 to \~{}9, neutral proteins indeed exhibit nearly zero net charge at pH \~{}9.

The theory of non-linear, non-ideal chromatography has given rise to numerous models whose advantages, disadvantages and ranges of application are now well understood. Interest now resides in investigating the equilibrium thermodynamics of complex new systems, in the study of the kinetics of mass transfers in conventional chromatographic systems, and in the application of the various models of chromatography to optimize the experimental conditions. Progress in computer technology allows the use of sophisticated models, provided their parameters can be measured. This allows the detailed investigation of separations for which the mass transfer kinetics is slow such as chiral separations, the purification of basic compounds, and the extraction of recombinant proteins. On the applied front, in addition to numerous incremental improvements in reliability and economic performance, a few essential new features should be noted, i.e. the availability of instruments for simulated moving bed separations at the scale needed for preparative chiral separations, the use of expanded beds for the extraction of recombinant proteins from fermentation broths, and the attention given to improvements in the performance of packed beds. A survey of the literature dealing with practical applications and recent meetings shows that preparative chromatography is becoming a well established separation and purification method in the pharmaceutical industry.},

The unknown model parameters estimated are the bed void, the axial dispersion coefficient, the liquid film mass transfer coefficient, the effective diffusion coefficient and the apparent bead porosity. All the parameters in the model were subsequently determined in three classes of experiments, the external mixing behaviour, the mobile phase behaviour and the stationary phase behaviour. The estimates are based on the sum of the least squares of the residuals between the experimental breakthrough curves and the model response. The methodology is exemplified by frontal experiments with lysozyme, bovine serum albumin and immuno globulin [gamma] on a well-defined column set-up.

abstract = {The competitive adsorption behavior of the binary mixture of phenetole (ethoxy-benzene) and propyl benzoate in a reversed-phase system was investigated. The adsorption equilibrium data of the single-component systems were acquired by frontal analysis. The same data for binary mixtures were acquired by the perturbation method. For both compounds, the single-component isotherm data fit best to the multilayer BET model. The experimental overloaded band profiles are in excellent agreement with the profiles calculated with either the general rate model or the modified transport-dispersive models. The competitive adsorption data were modeled using the ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) theory. The numerical values of the coefficients were derived by fitting the retention times of the perturbation pulses to those calculated using the IAS theory compiled with the coherence conditions. Finally, the elution profiles of binary mixtures were recorded. They compared very well with those calculated. As a characteristic feature of this case, an unusual retainment effect of the chromatographic band of the more retained component by the less retained one was observed. The combination of the General Rate Model and the adsorption isotherm model allowed an accurate prediction of the band profiles.},

abstract = {The interface between two fluids that have different viscosities and are percolating through a porous bed is unstable. Sooner or later, a flow instability termed viscous fingering (VF) develops. This phenomenon is important in chromatography because the solute plug does not have the same viscosity as the mobile phase. Because the sample is often much more viscous than the mobile phase, it is the interface at the rear of the sample band that is usually unstable. This situation is frequent in many modes of chromatography, e.g., in preparative and in multidimensional chromatography, in size exclusion chromatography, in frontal analysis, and in other physicochemical measurements (e.g., determination of adsorption isotherms and of mass transfer parameters). When the solute plug is more viscous than the mobile phase, we observed that the solute band compressed. When the viscosity contrast increased up to 0.30 cP, fingers appeared to trail behind the solute plug. The development of fingers then became more substantial as the viscosity contrast increased. To avoid effects associated with VF, the mobile phase and the solute plug should have nearly the same viscosity.},

In all cases, pore diffusion was the rate limiting step. Reduced heights equivalent to a theoretical plate for bovine serum albumin derived from breakthrough curves at reduced velocities between 60 and 1500 ranged from 10 to 700. Pore diffusion coefficients were derived from pulse response experiments for the model proteins [alpha]-lactalbumin, lysozyme, [beta]-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G. Diffusivity of lysozyme did not follow the trend of decreasing diffusivity with increasing molecular mass, as observed for the rest of the proteins. In general, mass transfer coefficients were smaller compared to ion-exchange chromatography. Dynamic binding capacities for the model protein bovine serum albumin varied within a broad range. However, sorbents based on polymethacrylate showed a lower dynamic capacity than media based on Sepharose. Some sorbents could be clustered regarding binding capacity affected by salt. These sorbents exhibited a disproportional increase of binding capacity with increasing ammonium sulfate concentration. Recovery of proteins above 75\% could be observed for all sorbents. Several sorbents showed a recovery close to 100\%.},

abstract = {A new experimental set-up for on-line visualization of the intra-particle uptake kinetics during packed bed chromatography has been designed and tested. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to analyze the dynamics of protein adsorption to porous stationary phases. In combination with this, a flow cell was developed that could be packed with chromatography media and operated as a fully functional mini-scale chromatography column. Adsorption profiles of single- and two-component mixtures containing BSA and IgG 2a during packed bed cation-exchange chromatography were investigated. The two proteins appear to exhibit different transport characteristics. For BSA a classical ldquoshrinking corerdquo behavior could be detected. The profiles obtained during IgG 2a adsorption point toward a different transport mode, which deviates from the classical pore-diffusion picture. For the two-component system, a superposition of the single-component profiles combined with a classical displacement of the weaker bound protein species was found. The results indicate that depending on the adsorbed protein the uptake can vary tremendously, even for adsorption to the same chromatographic support. It is clearly shown that the new microcolumn allows in situ quantitative investigations of protein adsorption dynamics within a single particle, which adds a new tool to the available methods for characterizing and optimizing protein adsorption chromatography. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {A comparative study was performed on strong cation-exchangers to investigate the pH dependence, efficiency, binding strength, particle size distribution, static and dynamic capacity, and SEM pictures of chromatographic resins. The resins tested included: SP Sepharose XL, Poros 50 HS, Toyopearl SP 550c, SP Sepharose BB, Source 30S, TSKGel SP-5PW-HR20, and Toyopearl SP 650c. Testing was performed with four different proteins: anti-FVII Mab (IgG), aprotinin, lysozyme, and myoglobin. Dependence of pH on retention was generally very low for proteins with high pI. An unexpected binding at pH 7.5 of anti-FVII Mab with pI<7.5 was observed on several resins. Efficiency results show the expected trend of higher dependence of the plate height with increasing flow rate of soft resins compared to resins for medium and high-pressure operation. Determination of particle size distribution by two independent methods, Coulter counting and SEM, was in very good agreement. The mono-dispersed nature of Source 30S was confirmed. Binding to cation-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength varies depending on the specific protein. Generally, binding and elution at high salt concentration may be performed with Toyopearl SP 550c and Poros 50 HS, while binding and elution at low salt concentration may be performed with Toyopearl SP 650c. A very high binding capacity was obtained with SP Sepharose XL. Comparison of static capacity and dynamic capacity at 10\% break-through shows in general approximately 50-80\% utilisation of the total available capacity during chromatographic operation. A general good agreement was obtained between this study and data obtained by others. The results of this study may be used for selection of resins for testing in process development. The validity of experiments and results with model proteins were tested using human insulin precursor in pure state and in real feed-stock on Toyopearl SP 550c, SP Sepharose BB, and Toyopearl SP 650c. Results showed good agreement with experiments with model proteins.},

The equilibrium isotherm of butyl benzoate is accounted for by the liquid-solid extended multilayer BET isotherm model. The total porosity of the column varies much with the butyl benzoate concentration, influencing strongly the parameters of its mass transfer kinetics and the profiles of the breakthrough curves. Using all these parameters, the general rate model of chromatography predicts band profiles and Van Deemter curves that are in excellent agreement with experimental results provided the influence of concentration on the porosity is properly taken into account. This agreement confirms the validity of the models selected for the isotherm and for the mass transfer kinetics.},

abstract = {We have performed a systematic experimental study of electrokinetic mobility depending on the mobile phase ionic strength (concentration of Tris buffer) using different, well-defined porous and, for reference behavior, nonporous silica-based spherical microparticles. Effects of both an intraparticle electrical double layer overlap and the porosity on electrophoretic mobility in dilute suspensions and electroosmotic mobility in fixed beds of the devised (non)porous particles were investigated. The electrokinetically consistent results demonstrate a substantially different behavior for the porous (i.e., permeable and conducting) particles with respect to nonporous (solid) spheres. It may be related to a porous particle's dipole coefficient via the intraparticle void volume and, strongly depending on mobile phase ionic strength, to the actual magnitude of electroosmotic flow jetted through a particle's interior. In contrast to the normal electrical double layer behavior observed for the solid spheres (continuous decrease of mobility with ionic strength), these competitive contributions give rise to pronounced maxima in the mobility of the porous spheres. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical analysis of Miller et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1992, 153, 237] which, depending on the double layer interaction within a porous aggregate of solid spheres, predicts (significantly) lower or higher mobilities with respect to an impermeable and nonconducting particle.},

abstract = {This work proposes methodologies using a model-based approach to gain knowledge on and assist the development of an ion-exchange step in a protein purification process; the separation of IgG from a mixture containing IgG, insulin and transferrin. This approach is suitable for capture and intermediate steps in a process. Both methods involve four consecutive steps. Firstly, the retention of the different protein components is determined giving a retention map of the system. From this the optimal pH and buffer can be determined. Secondly, additional salt gradient experiments are performed at the selected pH. Thirdly, experimental breakthrough curves have to be generated for the protein if the adsorption capacity of the medium for each component is not known. Fourthly, a validation experiment is performed. In method 1, where the capacity for the medium is assumed to be known, the protein adsorption is described by Langmuir kinetics with a mobile phase modulator (MPM). In this description salt is considered to be inert. In method 2 the adsorption behavior is described by steric mass action (SMA), where the salt component competes with the proteins for the available binding sites. Both methods use a dispersion model to describe transport in the mobile phase in the column. The methods are able to predict the separation and loading behavior of the three components. The methods can, with reasonable accuracy, predict the breakthrough of transferrin in a mixture of insulin, IgG and transferrin. Method 1 requires fewer experiments and predicts the mean volume of breakthrough for the loading step in the validation experiment more accurately than method 2. On the other hand, method 2 has a better accuracy to predict the position of 10\% breakthrough and the shape of the breakthrough curve. The methods suggested in this work are shown to be efficient in process development. Some additional experiments have to be performed to obtain the unknown parameters in the models. However, the predictability that is achieved results in less experimental work in the process design as a whole.},

This paper surveys different ways of using measurements to compensate for model uncertainty in the context of process optimization. Three approaches can be distinguished according to the quantities that are adapted: model-parameter adaptation updates the parameters of the process model and repeats the optimization, modifier adaptation modifies the constraints and gradients of the optimization problem and repeats the optimization, while direct input adaptation turns the optimization problem into a feedback control problem and implements optimality via tracking of appropriate controlled variables. This paper argues in favor of modifier adaptation, since it uses a model parameterization and an update criterion that are well tailored to meeting the KKT conditions of optimality. These considerations are illustrated with the real-time optimization of a semi-batch reactor system.},

abstract = {The radial void fraction distribution in randomly packed fixed beds of uniformly sized spheres in cylindrical containers is analyzed by a nondestructive method in which the center position coordinates of specially prepared spheres are experimentally obtained using X-ray radiography and the radial void fraction distribution is geometrically determined from these center coordinates. The geometrical solution for the radial void fraction distribution is derived by dividing the fixed packed bed of spheres into a large number of radial annular layers of equal thickness and the local void fraction in each layer is expressed in terms of the solid volume segments coming from each sphere. The radial void fraction distribution is presented for four different diameter aspect ratios, D/d, ranging from 2.02 to 7.99. The height aspect ratio, H/d, of each cylindrical container is approximately 7.84. Using the new data and existing data for the radial void fraction distribution, an empirical correlation with one principal equation is determined which accurately predicts the radial void fraction distribution for fixed packed beds of uniformly sized spheres in cylindrical containers. The correlation can be used for fixed packed beds with D/d > /2.02. The correlation can be also used in analytical and numerical transport models for fixed packed beds of uniformly sized spheres to closely approximate the radial void fraction in the near-wall region.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional velocity field and corresponding hydrodynamic dispersion in electrokinetic flow through a random bulk packing of impermeable, nonconducting spheres are studied by quantitative numerical analysis. First, a fixed bed with interparticle porosity of 0.38 is generated using a parallel collective-rearrangement algorithm. Then, the interparticle velocity field is calculated using the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method, and a random-walk particle-tracking method is finally employed to model advectiondiffusion of an inert tracer in the LB velocity field. We demonstrate that the pore-scale velocity profile for electroosmotic flow (EOF) is nonuniform even under most ideal conditions, including a negligible thickness of the electrical double layer compared to the mean pore size, a uniform distribution of the electrokinetic potential at the solidliquid interface, and the absence of applied pressure gradients. This EOF dynamics is caused by a nonuniform distribution of the local electrical field strength in the sphere packing and engenders significant hydrodynamic dispersion compared to pluglike EOF through a single straight channel. Both transient and asymptotic dispersion behaviors are analyzed for EOF in the context of packing microstructure and are compared to pressure-driven flow in dependence of the average velocity through the bed. A better hydrodynamic performance of EOF originates in a still much smaller amplitude of velocity fluctuations on a mesoscopic scale (covering several particle diameters), as well as on the microscopic scale of an individual pore.},

abstract = {Chromatography has developed from an analytical technology to a well-established separation process in industry. It is the method of choice for difficult separation tasks especially when temperature-sensitive components or species exhibiting very similar thermodynamic properties are involved. Large-scale industrial applications have been reported from different industrial fields, e.g. in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, bio-chemical, and also in the food industry. Chromatographic separations often cause a large fraction of the overall production cost, so efficient design and operation become mandatory when production cost matters for competitiveness. In this paper we present an overview of model-based techniques for optimisation and control of batch as well as continuous chromatographic separation processes. These methods also help to speed up process development which may even be more critical than the reduction of production cost.},

It was found that the packing structure depends mainly on the pipe-to-particle ratio and the particle friction. The numerical results with respect to the radial porosity distribution are in agreement with experimental data from the literature. Radial porosity distributions were calculated using algorithms developed by Mueller. The packing structure of the particles shows channeling for small pipe to particle diameter ratios. The simulated height averaged porosity distribution agrees with models from the literature. Moreover, DEM provides the possibility to include particle properties which reflect on the porosity distribution.},

@article{Golshan-Shirazi.Guiochon92JoCA,
abstract = {It is not possible to separate simply the influences of a slow mass transfer kinetics and of a slow kinetics of adsorption-desorption on the elution profile of a component. Four Kinetic models of chromatography are studied: (i) the Thomas or reaction model, which assumes Langmuir Kinetics of adsorption-desorption and no axial dispersion; (ii) the reaction-dispersive model, which uses the same Langmuir kinetics as the Thomas model but assumes a finite axial dispersion; (iii) a transport model, which uses the linear solid film driving force model to account for a slow kinetics of mass transfer and assumes no axial dispersion; and (iv) a transport-dispersive model, using the same mass transfer kinetics as the transport model and assumes finite axial dispersion. The analytical solution of the Thomas model can be fitted, with an accuracy which exceeds the precision of experimental measurements, on bands calculated using either one of the other three kinetic models of chromatography. Thus, the Thomas model, which assumes a slow adsorption-desorption kinetics and infinetely fast mass transfer kinetics, accounts very well for profiles calculated with a model making the reverse assumption. However, the values of the lumped kinetic coefficient obtained by curve fitting depend on the sample amount. Thus, the examination of an elution profile and its fitting to a model do not permit an easy solution of the inverse problem of chromatography.},

abstract = {For analysis, design and model-based control of crystallization processes typically population balance models or reduced models derived therefrom are used. Usually the kinetic parameters in these models are determined analyzing measured concentration trajectories and/or particle size distributions using parameter estimation procedures. In the case of preferential crystallization of enantiomers the analysis of experiments is complex since there are two "competing" crystal populations. In this field often batch processes are performed using seeds of the desired enantiomer. Currently, it is in particular challenging to quantify and optimize a new concept: e.g. the so-called "auto seeded programmed polythermal preferential crystallization" ("as3pc" [Coquerel, G., Petit, M.-N., Bouaziz, R., 2000. Method of resolution of two enantiomers by crystallization. United States Patent, Patent number: 6,022,409]). In order to design and optimize this process the temperature dependent kinetic constants for crystal growth, nucleation and dissolution have to be known. In this work a reduced model for this auto seeded process is presented. The general identifiability of the model parameters is investigated along with some suggestions on how to reparameterize the kinetic terms involved. The values of the identified key parameters are estimated using conventional least square optimization using experimental data determined for the model system threonine/water. Parameter confidence and cross correlation are discussed and finally the model is validated using experiments not used for parameter estimation.},

The yield requirement is varied between 80 and 95\% to study the effect on the production rate and the operating point.

abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Giddings pointed out in "Dynamics of Chromatography" that surface diffusion should become an important research topic in the kinetics of chromatographic phenomena. However, few studies on surface diffusion in adsorbents used in chromatography were published since then. Most scientists use ordinary rate equations to study mass transfer kinetics in chromatography. They take no account of surface diffusion and overlook the significant contributions of this mass transfer process to chromatographic behavior and to column efficiency at high mobile phase flow rate. Only recently did the significance of surface diffusion in separation processes begin to be recognized in connection with the development of new techniques of fast flow, high efficiency chromatography. In this review, we revisit the reports on experimental data on surface diffusion and introduce a surface-restricted molecular diffusion model, derived as a first approximation for the mechanism of surface diffusion, on the basis of the absolute rate theory. We also explain how this model accounts for many intrinsic characteristics of surface diffusion that cannot properly be explained by the conventional models of surface diffusion.},

Experimental data are obtained for the proteins lysozyme and albumin with a commercial agarose-based cation exchanger. Sharp rings are observed in both cases confirming that protein mass transfer within the particles occurs via a shell-progressive diffusion mechanism.

abstract = {The impact of different transport mechanism on chromatographic performance was studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for solutions containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and monoclonal IgG 2a under different solid- and fluid-phase conditions. During this investigation, a clear influence of the uptake mechanism on the affinity of the respective proteins for the different adsorbents and thus separation performance of the chromatographic process could be observed. For the system SP Sepharose(TM) Fast Flow at pH 4.5 pore diffusion could be ascribed to be the dominant transport mechanism for both proteins and the adsorption profiles resembled a pattern similar to that described by the [`]shrinking core' model. Under these conditions a significantly higher affinity towards the adsorbent was found for BSA when compared to IgG 2a. With changing fluid- and solid-phase conditions, however, a change of the transport mode for IgG 2a could be detected. While the exact mechanism is still unresolved it could be concluded that both occurrence and magnitude of the now governing transport mechanism depended on protein properties and interaction with the adsorbent surface. For the system SP Sepharose(TM) XL at pH 5.0 both parameters leading to the change in IgG 2a uptake were combined resulting in a clear change of the system affinity towards the IgG 2a molecule, while BSA adsorption was restricted to the most outer shell of the sorbent.},

abstract = {Pore-scale simulations of flow and transport offer the possibility of modeling laboratory-scale experiments without averaging the properties of the porous medium. Comparisons between simulation and experiment are complicated, however, by the difficulty of reproducing the exact geometry of the experimental porous medium in a simulation. Flow and dispersion are affected by differences in packing density, random packing variation, inhomogeneities, and confining walls. It is therefore important to understand the magnitude of such effects when comparing simulation and experiment. We quantify the sensitivity of pore-scale simulations of flow and dispersion to variations in packing density, the random packing algorithm, and selective sphere removal for the case of randomly packed spheres. The results allow us to interpret differences in dispersion between pore-scale simulations and NMR spectroscopy measurements in packed cylinders. Dispersion is analyzed in terms of the time-dependent dispersion coefficient and by the propagator function (i.e., the density function of solute mass versus mass propagation distance). The simulation and experimental propagator functions share important qualitative features, and there are no obvious problems such as an incorrect center of mass. However, the simulation underestimates experimental dispersion, and the underestimate is greater than can be explained by possible differences in packing density and random packing between the NMR and simulated sphere packings. An examination of NMR images of the experimental packing reveals regularities in packing structure and raises the possibility that nonrandom ordering could account for the difference in dispersion.},

Because of the complex dynamics of the process, the choice of the optimal operation parameters and the control of the process in order to keep the product specifications at any time is not straightforward. For this challenging task, a reliable dynamic model of the process is necessary which is accurate enough as well as efficient enough in order to permit its online use for model based control.

abstract = {Practical application of the general rate model is often hindered by computational complexity and by unknown parameter values. Model simplifications and parameter correlations are not always applicable, and repeated model solutions are required for parameter estimation and process optimization. We have hence developed and implemented a fast and accurate solver for the general rate model with various adsorption isotherms. Several state of the art scientific computing techniques have been combined for maximal solver performance: (1) the model equations are spatially discretized with finite volumes and the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method. (2) A non-commercial solver with variable stepwidth and order is applied for time integration. (3) The internal linear solver module is replaced by customized code that is based on domain decomposition and can be executed on parallel computers. We demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our solver with numerical examples. The WENO method significantly improves accuracy even on rather coarse grids, and the solver runtime scales linearly with relevant grid sizes and processor numbers. Code parallelization is essential for utilizing the full power of multiprocessor and multicore technology in modern personal computers. The general rate model of a strongly non-linear two component system is solved in few seconds.},

abstract = {An optimization based model that simulates random packings of polydisperse particles to mimic porous media systems is presented in this paper. The model simulates systems with properties that map back to physically measured quantities. The model is composed of three main procedures: detachment of an existing sphere from a target sphere by moving its center to a new position, movement of an existing sphere to touch the target sphere, and addition of a new sphere to touch the target sphere. Each procedure is performed to satisfy a constrained nonlinear optimization formulation. Input parameters include radius and coordination numbers density functions. A monodisperse and polydisperse packings were simulated by incorporating physically based properties of glass bead packings obtained from 3D computed tomography images. In each simulated system, the packing density obtained was very close to the packing density of the physical system. The packings were tested for isotropy, homogeneity and randomness and then compared to experimental microtomography images. Findings indicate that the packings generated were isotropic, homogenous, random, and in a good agreement with the experimental data.},

SP Sepharose(TM) Fast Flow is characterised by a relatively open pore network, while SP Sepharose(TM) XL is a composite structure with ligand-carrying dextran chains filling the pore space. Both adsorbents have similar ionic capacity. Protein transport and adsorption profiles were evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Under all investigated conditions, BSA uptake could be adequately explained by a pore diffusion mechanism. The adsorption profiles obtained for IgG 2a, however, indicated that changes in fluid phase conditions as well as a change in the solid phase structure could result in a more complex uptake mechanism as compared to pore diffusion alone. This mechanism results in a fast transport of proteins into the adsorbent, followed by an overshoot of protein in the center of the sorbent and a setback towards a homogeneous adsorption profile.},

The major problem with gradient elution is that the development, scaleup, and optimization of the process depend on trial and error. This is usually time-consuming and expensive, especially for large-scale processes. Using chemical engineering concepts, the optimization of gradient elution chromatography consisted of two parts. In the first part, rate parameters and gradient correlations were determined according to experimental data from isocratic elution runs. In the second part, which is the main focus of this study, the optimization strategy of gradient elution chromatography based on the resolution optimization factor was developed. The resolution optimization factor considered not only the product purity and yield but also the operating time and product dilution. The methodology of optimizing gradient profiles for elution chromatography was demonstrated for protein purification.},

@article{Staby.etal05JoCA,
abstract = {A comparative study was performed on heparin resins and strong and weak cation exchangers to investigate the pH dependence, efficiency, binding strength, particle size distribution, static and dynamic capacity, and scanning electron microscopy pictures of chromatographic resins. The resins tested include: Heparin Sepharose FF, SP Sepharose FF, CM Sepharose FF, Heparin Toyopearl 650m, SP Toyopearl 650m, CM Toyopearl 650m, Ceramic Heparin HyperD M, Ceramic S HyperD 20, and Ceramic CM HyperD F. Testing was performed with four different proteins: anti-FVII Mab (IgG), aprotinin, lysozyme, and myoglobin. Dependence of pH on retention was generally very low for proteins with high isoelectric point (pI), though some decrease of retention with increasing pH was observed for CM Ceramic HyperD F and S Ceramic HyperD 20. Binding of anti-FVII Mab with pI < 7.5 was observed on several resins at pH 7.5. Efficiency results show the expected trend of increasing dependence of the plate height with increasing flow rate of Ceramic HyperD resins followed by Toyopearl 650m resins and the highest flow dependence of the Sepharose FF resins corresponding to their pressure resistance. Determination of particle size distribution by two independent methods, coulter counting and SEM, was in good agreement. Binding strength of cation-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength varies depending on the protein. Binding and elution at high salt concentration may be performed with Ceramic HyperD resins, while binding and elution at low salt concentration may be performed with model proteins on heparin resins. Employing proteins with specific affinity for heparin, a much stronger binding is observed, however, some cation exchangers may still be good substitutions for heparin resins. Dynamic capacity at 10\% breakthrough compared to static capacity measurements and dynamic capacity displays that approximately 40-80\% of the total available capacity is utilized during chromatographic operation depending on flow rate. A general good agreement was obtained between results of this study and data obtained by others. Results of this study may be used in the selection of resins for testing during protein purification process development.},

abstract = {The application of an impulse technique to determine the Langmuir isotherm parameters of amino acids and proteins in ion-exchange chromatography is described. The ion-exchange column is approximated as many stages in series. Within each stage. the mass transfer rate of a given solute between mobile and stationary phases is finite. Responses to pulse and step changes are calculated using a fast and stable algorithm. The equilibrium parameters are estimated by comparing the responses with the experimental data. The sensitivity of the response with respect to equilibrium and mass transfer parameters was studied. The accuracy of estimation of the equilibrium parameters depends strongly on the pulse volume and pulse concentration. A methodology for selecting the proper pulse parameters was developed and successfully used to determine the equilibrium parameters of phenylalanine and bovine serum albumin. The stage model represents pulse data as closely as a more detailed rate equation model while requiring two orders of magnitude less computation time. This technique offers a fast alternative to the conventional batch equilibrium and frontal analysis methods for determining equilibrium isotherms. The impulse technique requires fewer laboratory manipulations than the batch method and, as a result, the data are less scattered. More important, it requires only 1\% as much substrate as batch methods and is of value in estimating the equilibrium parameters of costly biochemicals.},

Our description is evaluated using simple geometries as those encountered in open-channel microfluidic devices. In particular, we consider electroosmosis in straight cylindrical capillaries with a (non)uniform zeta-potential distribution for ratios of the capillary inner radius to the thickness of the electrical double layer from 10 to 100. The general case of heterogeneous zeta-potential distributions at the surface of a capillary requires solution of the following coupled equations in three dimensions: Navier-Stokes equation for liquid flow, Poisson equation for electrical potential distribution, and the Nernst-Planck equation for distribution of ionic species. The hydrodynamic problem has been treated with high efficiency by code parallelization through the lattice-Boltzmann method. For validation velocity fields were simulated in several microcapillary systems and good agreement with results predicted either theoretically or obtained by alternative numerical methods could be established. Results are also discussed with respect to the use of a slip boundary condition for the velocity field at the surface. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A survey of available surface diffusion information, all at higher coverages, indicated that the results reported here are at the lower end of the range of diffusivities. The activation energy and heat of adsorption, for example, for n-butane, were 4.4 and -7.8 k cal./mole, respectively.Surface diffusion was a significant fraction of the total intraparticle mass transport, in part because in the small pores in silica gel gas phase diffusion was solely by the Knudsen mechanism.

It is shown that, under unretained solute conditions, very small structural variations of the order of only 5\% of the particle diameter can give rise to a 4-fold increase of the band-broadening. A comprehensive study has been made to quantify this effect as a function of the fluid velocity, the particle diameter, the channel widths, and of course, the sidewall region design. Because the sidewall effect can be fully attributed to a mismatch between the flow rates in the column center and in the sidewall region, it is fortunately also quite straightforward to avoid it. A very simple design, yielding band-broadening values identical to that of a hypothetical sidewall-less column for all possible values of the flow velocity, the particle diameter, or the channel width is proposed.},

For this study, prototype HPLC microchips were developed that are characterized by minimal dead volume, a separation channel with trapezoidal cross section, and on-chip UV detection. A custom-built stainless steel holder enabled microchip packing under pressures of up to 400 bar and ultrasonication. Bed densities were investigated with respect to the packing conditions and consistently related to pressure drop over the packed microchannels and separation efficiency under isocratic elution conditions. The derived plate height curves show a decrease of mobile phase mass transfer resistance with increasing bed density. High bed densities are critical to separation performance in noncylindrical packed beds, because only at low bed porosities does hydrodynamic dispersion in noncylindrical packings come close to that of cylindrical packings. At higher bed porosities, the presence of fluid channels of advanced flow velocity in the corners of noncylindrical packings affects hydrodynamic dispersion strongly. We demonstrate that the separation channels of HPLC microchips can be packed as densely as the cylindrical fused-silica capillaries used in nano-HPLC and that consequently microchip-HPLC separation efficiencies comparable to those of nano-HPLC can be achieved.},

Three pure proteins and their mixture were used (alpha-lactalbumin, BSA, and conalbumin) under different operational conditions. The anionic matrix Q-Sepharose FF was used packed in a 1 mL column. A high protein concentration (37.5 mg/mL of total protein injected into the column) was used in order to extend the utility of the model. Mass transfer parameters were calculated using empiric correlations, where the axial dispersion was negligible (Pe \&gt; 300) and the mass transfer was controlled by the intraparticle diffusion (Bi \&gt; 10). The model assumes a modulator-eluite relationship were the equilibrium constant of the Langmuir isotherm was a function of salt concentration. Adsorption kinetic parameters were estimated from experimental data. The parameters for pure proteins were determined, and elution curves for changes in flow rate, ionic strength gradient, concentration, and sample size were predicted by the model. Then the kinetic parameters of the mixture were determined under the same operational conditions and some of the parameters had to be modified to take into account effects such as protein-protein interactions, competition, and displacement. Experimental elution curves obtained for changes in operational conditions such as flow rate and ionic strength gradient were simulated by the rate model for the protein mixture with a relative error in retention time of visible peaks \&lt;5\%. IEC operational conditions and the peak fraction collection can be selected using a cost function of the production process which considers yield, purity, concentration, and process time that are obtained from simulations. Operational conditions that gave the minimum cost were selected. Simulations allows to diminish experimental time and cost. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009; 104: 572-581 © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {In an attempt to quantify the potential of photolithographically etched micro-pillar arrays as a perfectly ordered alternative for the packed bed of spheres, the additional band broadening originating from the top and bottom plate has been investigated using computational fluid dynamics simulations. These calculations provide insight in the theoretical expectations that can be made for the experimental work that is currently being conducted by a number of groups. The calculations show that the additional band broadening contribution can be expected to go through a transient regime as a function of the axial distance along the array. In its fully developed regime and in the most relevant velocity range, the top and bottom wall contribution almost doubles the band broadening compared to the band broadening in a perfectly ordered array of non-porous, non-retentive pillars without top and bottom wall. Compared to the band broadening in an array of porous, retentive pillars on the other hand, the top and bottom wall-effect can be expected to become negligible. A simplified, phenomenological model yielding a first principles prediction of both the transient and the steady-state top and bottom wall band broadening as a function of the inter-pillar distance and the pillar height is proposed and shows good qualitative agreement with the exact calculations.},

It is not trivial to generate such random packing at a large scale, particularly when spheres of various sizes and geometric domains of different shapes are present. Motivated by the idea of compression complemented by an efficient physical process to increase packing density, shaking, a new approach, termed compression algorithm, is proposed in this work to randomly fill any arbitrary polyhedral or cylindrical domains with spheres of various sizes. The algorithm features both simplicity and high efficiency. Tests show that it takes 181 s on a 1.4-GHz PC to complete the filling of a cylindrical domain with a total number of 26,787 spheres, achieving a packing density of 52.89\%.},

These chips were batch-fabricated on a silicon wafer using photolithographic processes and with Parylene as the main structural material. The fabricated chip includes three electrolysis-based electrochemical pumps, one for loading the sample and the other two for delivering the solvent gradient; platinum electrodes for delivering current to the pumps and establishing the electrospray potential; a low-volume static mixer; a column packed with silica-based reversed-phase support; integrated frits for bead capture; and an electrospray nozzle. The fabricated structures were able to withstand pressures in excess of 250 psi. The device was used to perform a liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) analysis of a mixture of peptides from the trypsin digestion of bovine serum albumen (BSA). Gradient elution through the 1.2-cm column was performed at a flow rate of 80 nL/min. Compared to the analysis of the same sample using a commercial nanoflow LC system, the chromatographic resolution was nearly as good, and the total cycle time was significantly reduced because of the minimal volume between the pumps and the column. Results demonstrate the potential of mass-produced, low-cost microfluidic systems capable of performing LC separations for proteomics applications.},

abstract = {Today, the optimization of chromatographic separation is usually based on experimental work and rule of thumb. The process and analytical technology (PAT) initiative, of the US Food and Drug Administration, has provided the opportunity of using model-based approach when designing downstream processing of pharmaceutical substances. A nonlinear chromatography model was used in this study to optimize a preparative ion-exchange separation step involving two components. Separation was simulated with the general rate model employing Langmuir kinetics. Optimization was performed with an indirect method allowing constraints on the purity, thus avoiding sub-optimization, which can lead to noisy objective functions. The six decision variables used in the optimizations were flow rate, loading volume, initial salt concentration in the elution, final salt concentration in the linear elution gradient and the two cut points. A graphical representation of the effect of the decision variables on the objective function was used to verify that the optimization had converged to the true optimum. The optimal operating points, using productivity and yield separately as objective functions, were found and compared with the product of productivity and yield as objective function. The optimum obtained with this objective function had a lower productivity, than the productivity function, but much higher yield, which makes it a good substitute for a cost function.},

abstract = {In the production of pharmaceutical drugs, a large part of the production costs stem from the downstream processing and the chromatographic purifications required. In order to reduce purification costs the process performance must be increased, which means that the processes need to be less robust since robustness comes with the price of lower process performance, and thus, higher production costs. It is difficult to find a good estimate of the robustness of a process experimentally, and therefore, the pharmaceutical industry has been forced to design processes to be very robust. This work presents a model-based method for optimizing purification processes both with regard to performance and robustness. A model of chromatographic processes and methods of calibration are presented. The model is then used to determine the operating conditions with highest performance when robustness is not taken into account. With this as a starting point, the process is then optimized for higher robustness and lower probability of batch failure. The purification of Immunoglobulin G through ion exchange chromatography is used to demonstrate the method.},

The uptake curve was simulated with three mass transport models (i.e., effective pore diffusion model, surface diffusion model and Maxwell-Stefan model) incorporating the particle size distribution of the adsorbent particles. All the three models can simulate the uptake curves reasonably well. However, how well these models could simulate the real concentration profile within the adsorbent particle cannot be verified by the fitness of the models to the uptake curve. Thus, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to visualize protein uptake to the porous adsorbent particles during the batch experiments. Using a fluorescent dye-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) for the dynamic adsorption experiments, the radial concentration profiles of the labeled BSA molecules into individual adsorbent particles at different times were obtained from the CLSM images. The protein distribution profiles within various particle diameters at different time were compared with the radial protein distributions predicted from the models. It reveals that surface diffusion model describes the intraparticle protein concentration profiles better than the other two models.},

abstract = {The mass transport properties of bulk random sphere packings depend primarily on the bed (external) porosity ?, but also on the packing microstructure. We investigate the influence of the packing microstructure on the diffusive tortuosity ?=D(m)/D(eff), which relates the bulk diffusion coefficient (D(m)) to the effective (asymptotic) diffusion coefficient in a porous medium (D(eff)), by numerical simulations of diffusion in a set of computer-generated, monodisperse, hard-sphere packings. Variation of packing generation algorithm and protocol yielded four Jodrey-Tory and two Monte Carlo packing types with systematically varied degrees of microstructural heterogeneity in the range between the random-close and the random-loose packing limit (?=0.366-0.46). The distinctive tortuosity-porosity scaling of the packing types is influenced by the extent to which the structural environment of individual pores varies in a packing, and to quantify this influence we propose a measure based on Delaunay tessellation. We demonstrate that the ratio of the minimum to the maximum void face area of a Delaunay tetrahedron around a pore between four adjacent spheres, (A(min)/A(max))(D), is a measure for the structural heterogeneity in the direct environment of this pore, and that the standard deviation ? of the (A(min)/A(max))(D)-distribution considering all pores in a packing mimics the tortuosity-porosity scaling of the generated packing types. Thus, ?(A(min)/A(max))(D) provides a structure-transport correlation for diffusion in bulk, monodisperse, random sphere packings.},

The continuity equation for fixed-bed adsorption with axial dispersion is solved for the constant pattern concentration profile with the axial velocity characterized by a general axisymmetric function and the system having no resistances to external or intraparticle mass transfer. The isotherm is slightly favorable (i.e., concave downward) in order to justify the assumption that axial gradients of concentration are independent of the radial coordinate in the bed, as in the classical problem of Taylor diffusion. A series expansion of a general isotherm is used to treat adsorption equilibrium. The solution reveals the formation of a radial gradient of fluid-phase concentration and breakthrough behavior at the bed outlet dependent on the nonlinearity of the isotherm and the magnitude of the nonplug-flow-velocity profile. The results can be used to predict the breadth of the breakthrough wave of many chromatographic-type processes for packed beds and slightly favorable isotherms.},

Conventionally a series of chromatographic experiments are performed and the optimal conditions are selected according to the separation criteria. Computer-aided process design uses the same strategy, except a group of related experiments are generated by computer simulation. The access to concrete separation parameters for valid simulation necessitates chromatographic experiments. Optimal conditions are determined in the same manner as conducted in the conventional strategy. Beside other parameters, the distribution coefficient (K) determines the performance of a chromatographic purification under overloading conditions. In ion-exchange chromatography the distribution coefficient is strongly influenced by the protein concentration (C) and the salt concentration (I). A strategy to derive the distribution coefficient from chromatographic experiments, such as isocratic runs (pulse response), linear gradients, and frontal analysis, is described and compared to previously published strategies. In ion-exchange chromatography, the number of plates and transfer units change with the salt concentration. The distribution coefficient for salt also changes under various conditions including salt and protein concentration. The number of plates and transfer units also vary with the flow rate. Furthermore criteria such as the multicomponent situation require a more complex mathematical treatment. Several solutions have been validated to circumvent those obstacles. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Summary A general plate height equation has been derived to express the effect of axial dispersion in the interstitial space, mass transfer resistances at the boundary and in the interior of porous stationary phase particles, and kinetic resistances associated with the reversible binding of eluite by the stationary phase. The last process is assumed to obey a simple kinetic law for a single-step reaction. In the case of a given chromatographic run with a sample whose components have commensurate diffusivities and rate constants for binding, the general plate height equation can be rearranged to yield for the dependence of the effective plate height,Heff, on the distribution ratio,k', the equationHeff =a +bk'-1 +ck'-2. From the parameters of this equation, the plate height contributions of axial dispersion, kinetic resistances and extra-column band spreading can be evaluated, provided that the plate height contribution arising from diffusion resistances can be calculated independently. The use of this approach is appropriate if the plot of peak width against the distribution ratio is linear at sufficiently highk' values. Plate height increments have been evaluated from experimental data obtained with various microparticulate columns under different conditions. The results show the contribution of the individual physico-chemical phenomena to the plate heights measured in a given chromatographic system. The effect of kinetic resistances on the performance of microparticulate columns has been found to be significant. Thus, a lower practical limit for the particle size in high-performance liquid chromatography may be imposed by the slow kinetics of eluite-stationary phase interactions as well.},

@article{Mollerup07JoB,
abstract = {In chromatography, macromolecules do not adsorb in the traditional sense of the word but bind to ligands that are covalently bonded to the surface of the porous bead. Therefore, the adsorption must be modelled as a process where protein molecules bind to the immobilised ligands. The paper discusses the general thermodynamic principles of ligand binding. Models of the multi-component adsorption in ion-exchange and hydrophobic chromatography, HIC and RPLC, are developed. The parameters in the models have a well-defined physical significance. The models are compared to the Langmuir model. In the traditional adsorption models, the standard state Gibbs energy change of adsorption does not depend level of occupancy, but when it depends on the level of occupancy it gives rise to an adsorptive behaviour known as cooperativity. The binding of oxygen to haemoglobin is a well-known example from biology but it is also observed in chromatography due to protein-protein interactions. Retention measurements on [beta]-lactoglobulin A demonstrate this. A discussion of salt effects on hydrophobic interactions in precipitation and chromatography of proteins concludes the paper.},

It is shown that this non-invasive technique is very useful for visualization of the inner part of a packed column and measurement of the spatial resolved column packing properties. For evaluation of the influence of the particle shape on the velocity distribution and column performance, irregular and spherical reversed phases were studied in detail. The results showed a decreasing velocity towards the column wall most certainly due to a lower permeability. This effect was much less pronounced in the case of spherical particles, indicating a more homogenous packing structure. The influence of the column packing pressure, as a possible measure for improvement of the packing homogeneity was also studied. It was shown that under the same packing conditions spherical particles always lead to a more homogeneous packing. The overall results of this work contribute to the origin of the fact that spherical material is superior to irregular one from the hydrodynamic point of view.},

Adsorption patterns largely follow the intrinsic protein-surface interactions, but can differ significantly for different pairs or even for one pair at different solution conditions. LYS/CYC adsorption shows similar behavior on all the adsorbents examined, with competitive adsorption dominated by LYS and the presence of LYS reducing the adsorption of CYC significantly. Simultaneous and sequential measurements for LYS/CYC show that the order of adsorption does not have a significant effect on the adsorption equilibrium. For LYS/RNase, LYS is consistently more strongly adsorbed. For CYC/RNase, both proteins can display significant adsorption, depending on the pH and salt concentration. A model based on colloidal energetics is developed to calculate the binary adsorption isotherms using parameter values obtained from single-component isotherms. The calculated adsorption is in good agreement with experimental results, with significantly better representation than for other commonly used binary isotherms.},

abstract = {We present a numerical scheme for analyzing steady-state isothermal electroosmotic flow (EOF) in three-dimensional random porous media, involving solution of the coupled Poisson, Nernst-Planck, and Navier-Stokes equations. While traditional finite-difference methods were used to resolve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck problem, the (electro)hydrodynamics has been addressed with high efficiency using the lattice-Boltzmann method. The developed model allows simulation of electrokinetic transport under most general conditions, including arbitrary value and distribution of electrokinetic potential at the solid\^{a}ˆ’liquid interface, electrolyte composition, and pore space morphology. The approach provides quantitative information on a spatial distribution of simulated velocities. This feature was utilized to characterize EOF fields in regular and random, confined and bulk packings of hard (i.e., impermeable, nonconducting) spheres. Important aspects of pore space morphology (sphere size distribution), surface heterogeneity (mismatch in electrokinetic potentials at confining wall and sphere surface), and fluid phase properties (electrical double layer thickness) were investigated with respect to their influence on the EOF dynamics over microscopic and macroscopic spatial domains. Most important is the observation of a generally nonuniform pore-level EOF velocity profile in the sphere packings (even in the thin double layer limit) which is caused by pore space morphology and which is in contrast to the pluglike velocity distribution in a single, straight capillary under the same conditions.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional steady water flow through unsaturated aggregated porous materials composed of simple cubic open packed and tetrahedral close packed assemblies of uniform porous spheres is investigated with electric analogues and numerical computations. Water around the spheres is considered to be discontinuous with flow restricted through isolated annular water lenses held by surface tension forces around the contact points between spheres. It is found that the conductance of individual spheres depends only on the size of the water lenses and is independent of the radius of the sphere. For a simple cubic packing the conductance for small lens radii is given by Weber\^{a}€™s formula for flow from an electrified disc into an infinite medium. It follows that the bulk hydraulic conductivity of these assemblies of porous spheres is also independent of aggregate size over a range of water contents. This independence is also shown in measurements of hydraulic conductivity of aggregates of diatomaceous earth that show a convergence to a single relationship between conductivity and water content when there is no longer continuity of water in the macropore space. The effect of the three-dimensional flow through aggregates on solute leaching is demonstrated by considering the numerical results of the stream-tube pattern in a sphere.},

A modified conjugate gradient optimization method determines the packing object's final packing location and orientation. Once the bed is packed, both macroscopic quantities like the overall porosity, the specific surface area, and the number of packing objects per unit volume and microscopic properties like the porosity variation in any direction could be determined. For accurate porosity calculation inside a given 3-D polygonal sample space, the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipper algorithm was used.

The critical process parameters are identified by simulating process disturbances, and this information is then used to determine if the process control space is robust. Simulations are chosen to analyze the entire control space to also find nonlinearities and interaction effects between the process disturbances, which are used to determine where in the control space the critical quality attributes are the lowest, i.e., the worst case scenario. The real process conditions are estimated by running simulations according to plausible probability distributions using Latin hypercube sampling. The probability of batch failure can be estimated from this and it is shown that the worst case scenario is improbable for most cases. This information can help in planning validation experiments or determine which critical process parameters need a tighter control. Three case studies are used to illustrate the usefulness of the methods. It was found that the main critical process parameters in all three case studies were variations in the modifier concentrations, for example, salt in ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and the organic modifier in reversed-phase chromatography.},

We have measured the parameters appropriate to the adsorption stages of affinity systems involving immobilised Cibacron Blue and immobilised monoclonal antibodies against [beta]-galactosidase. The theoretical predictions appear to agree well with the experimental performance of batch and packed column affinity systems.

abstract = {A self-contained research system based on the technique of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was put up to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of protein adsorption to porous cation exchanger by mathematical modeling. Bovine serum albumin adsorption to the cation exchanger SP Sepharose FF was performed by batch adsorption and micro-flow cell in which protein concentration in single absorbent was visualized by CLSM. The effects of ionic strength and the protein concentration in liquid phase (50 mmol/L acetate buffer, pH 5.0) on the adsorption dynamics were examined. The intraparticle concentration profile data experimentally obtained from CLSM were quantitatively analyzed by three diffusive mass transfer models (i.e., pore diffusion, surface diffusion and Maxwell-Stefan models (MSM)) in virtue of the attenuation equation for the CLSM visualization developed earlier. The nuance between the model simulations and experimental results of the developing protein distribution in a single adsorbent particle could thus be found out. Without salt addition to the buffer, the adsorption isotherm was strongly favorable, and the pore diffusion model (PorDM) and MSM gave similarly good simulations of the experiments, whereas the surface diffusion model was unreasonable in the model presumption. Moreover, it was observed that the experimentally obtained adsorption front was relative flatter as compared with the calculated results from the PorDM, which implied the possible existence of surface diffusion. With increasing salt concentration, the simulations became to deviate from the experiments. Especially, when the salt concentration approached 50 mmol/L, all the three mass transfer models could hardly give good simulation of the experiment. This was considered due to the difference in adsorption behavior between the fluorescence labeled and unlabeled proteins therein.},

To obtain agreement with measured data, both the mathematical form and the numerical values of these parameters are subject to quite stringent restriction.},

abstract = {Recently preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been used more and more frequently to separate drugs and natural substances. However, large-scale HPLC easily tends to reduce the yield and purity of the product. Hydrodynamic and heat factors play an important roles. Generally, in a large-scale HPLC column, the tracer profile inside column will take on a parabolic shape because of the distributor, which will impact the separation performance of the column. With the inlet temperature suitably lower than the wall temperature, this situation could be improved to some extent. In this work, some experiments were conducted using HPLC, with a column 10 cm in diameter to determine the optimal temperature difference between wall and inlet temperatures. The wall temperature was fixed at about 30 °C and the inlet temperature varied from 15 to 30 °C. The flow-rate of the eluent, methanol, was 300 ml/min. The experimental result was simulated using CFD software 4.4.4. The simulated temperature field fitted the experimental one very well and the simulated flow, temperature and tracer distribution inside column could provide good explanation of separation performance under different conditions. In addition, the simulation could at least approximately predict the optimal temperature difference.},

abstract = {In the production of monoclonal antibodies, separate chains of the antibody are often present in the product mixture as well as other contaminating proteins. These fragments should be removed from the whole antibodies. This paper shows the purification of monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) from its heavy chain contaminant. The heavy chain fragment is simulated experimentally using bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has approximately the same molecular weight. The purification is performed using traditional size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and using surfactant-aided SEC (SASEC), testing two different surfactants (C12E23 and Tween20) and two different gels (Sephacryl S200HR and Sephacryl S300 HR). Pulse experiments show that with SASEC both BSA and IgG are more distributed towards the solid phase than compared to using SEC. This effect is larger on IgG, the largest component than on BSA. As a consequence, azeotropes will be formed at a specific surfactant concentration. Above this concentration the selectivity is reversed and increased to values higher than obtained with conventional SEC. At 7.5\% (w/w) of C12E23, BSA actually elutes before IgG. These experiments further show that when using SASEC larger productivity, higher yields and lower solvent consumption can be achieved without loss of purity of IgG when compared to conventional SEC. Mathematical simulation of the separation of BSA and IgG using simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography indicates a large increase in productivity when applying a surfactant gradient in SASEC SMB compared to conventional isocratic SEC-SMB. Furthermore, solvent consumption reductions with a factor 15 prove possible as well as concentrating the IgG by a factor 2.},

abstract = {The linear gradient mode of chromatography is the most widely employed mode of operation in ion-exchange chromatographic separations. However, in recent years, the displacement mode has received considerable attention because of its promise of high throughput and high resolution. To enable a comparison of these two modes of chromatography, it is essential to identify the optimum operating conditions for each. We employed an iterative algorithm to carry out the necessary optimization. The Steric Mass Action model of ion-exchange chromatography is used in concert with the solid-film linear-driving force model to describe the chromatographic behavior of the solutes in these systems. The performances of displacement and gradient modes of chromatography are compared for different types of separation problems. It turns out that for ldquoeasyrdquo separations, both the modes are equally effective. However, for challenging separations, the displacement mode is superior to the gradient mode. Our results shed significant light on the performance of gradient and displacement modes in protein ion-exchange systems. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biotechnol Bioeng 78: 365-375, 2002.},

To face this challenge, design and development of efficient separation processes has become crucial. As a step towards boosting the performance of a chromatographic separation process through improved design, we investigated the potential of recycling as a process option. The most important advantage of recycling is that it can be implemented in an existing batch system without any major investment and consultation. Although impure products are recycled in industries, it is done as additional batch, and only then, when the recoverable product is valuable enough to surpass the loss of productivity in running the additional batches. In our study, on the other hand, it was found that a well-designed recycle can not only improve the yield, but also the productivity of a multi-component purification. A series of multiobjective optimization studies were carried out on multi-component separation to comprehend the role of recycling with reference to an industrially relevant problem, i.e. the chromatographic purification step of the production process of calcitonin.},

Topographic structures have been incorporated in the channels during their microfabrication, offering a variety of possibilities for the separation of (mainly) DNA molecules based on different principles. Supports for a stationary phase for chromatographic separations have been introduced in the channels in different ways: by packing of the channels with stationary phase particles, by polymerization of monolithic structures, or by lithographic machining of pillars in the channels. It is shown that the latter strategy gives the highest potential for increasing the separation power of the devices. Still, more conventional approaches are closer to a routine application.},

It results in a transcolumn velocity profile which depends on the column-to-particle diameter ratio and causes additional longitudinal dispersion. (ii) Compared to the pressure-driven flow through the porous medium, the intraparticle mass transfer rate constant is significantly increased under the influence of a potential gradient. This increase also depends on the buffer concentration via electric double layer overlap. (iii) Fluid molecules in the porous particles remain diffusion-limited in the presence of a pressure gradient. By contrast, intraparticle Peclet numbers above unity have been measured for electroosmotic flow and were found to increase with the applied potential difference.

The solid film linear driving force model has been employed in concert with the Steric Mass Action formalism of ion-exchange chromatography to describe the chromatographic behavior in these systems. Simple pulse techniques have been employed to estimate the transport parameters. The iterative scheme has been validated using a rigorous Feasible Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm. Finally, the utility of the iterative optimization scheme as a methods development tool for displacement separations has been demonstrated for a difficult separation.

The unknown parameter values are estimated from batch uptake experiments on a robotic platform and from dynamic breakthrough experiments with miniaturized chromatographic columns. The identified model is then validated with respect to process optimization by comparison of model predictions with experimental data from a preparative scale column. In this study, a strong cation exchanger Toyopearl SP-650M and lysozyme solved in phosphate buffer (pH 7), is used as the test system.

abstract = {Peak parking experiments have been performed on three RP-HPLC different columns, using two different components and a variable mobile phase composition. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the B-term diffusion expressions currently used in the literature (which are all Knox-type models) should be replaced by the effective diffusion expressions that have been developed in the frame of the effective medium theory (EMT). Although the EMT-expressions are not fully accurate either (the mathematics of the complex interactions between different diffusion zones that are in close contact are too demanding to catch them in an exact analytical expression), they at least are physically sound and do not violate Maxwell's basic law of diffusion. Further they also provide a much better approximation of the numerically calculated effective diffusivity in the theoretical test situation considered in part I. The present study shows that the values of the surface or stationary phase diffusion coefficient that are derived from peak parking models can depend heavily on the employed B-term model. The EMT-based B-term expressions lead to values of the surface diffusion coefficient that vary much less strongly with the phase retention factor than if one of the Knox-type models is used to analyze the data. This implies that, since all peak parking experiments that have been performed in the past have all been interpreted with a Knox-type model, the conclusions that have been drawn from these studies should all be moderated or at least revisited.},

Although, there are different possibilities to perform periodical inlet concentration changes, in this paper only simultaneous changes for both components were considered. The adsorption of phenol and 2-phenylethanol on octadecyl silica was analyzed experimentally using a mixture of methanol and water as a solvent.

abstract = {The axial and transverse diffusion coefficients of a band of iodine in a chromatographic column were measured optically as a function of time. It was found that the axial diffusion coefficient remains constant even when the edges of the sample band get close to the wall. By contrast, the radial diffusion coefficient decreases progressively with increasing time when the edges of the sample band leave the core region and begin to diffuse inside the wall region. The local axial and transverse diffusion coefficients of the band decrease from the column center toward the wall. Hence, the increase in local height equivalent to a theoretical plate observed in the region close to the wall must be explained by increasing mass transfer resistances and degree of heterogeneity of the bed.},

The effect of such a loading strategy was evaluated using a chromatographic model that was able to accurately predict experimental breakthrough curves for this Protein-A system. A gradient-based optimization routine is carried out to establish the optimal loading conditions (initial and final flowrates and switching time). The two-step loading strategy (using a higher flowrate during the initial stages followed by a lower flowrate) was evaluated for an Fc-fusion protein and was found to result in significant improvements in process throughput. In an extension of this optimization routine, dynamic loading capacity and productivity were simultaneously optimized using a weighted objective function, and this result was compared to that obtained with the single flowrate. Again, the dual-flowrate strategy was found to be superior.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional velocity field and corresponding hydrodynamic dispersion in pressure-driven flow through fixed beds of solid (impermeable), uniformly sized, spherical particles are studied by quantitative numerical analysis for conduits with different cross-sectional geometries. Packings with average interparticle porosities (bed porosities) of 0.40 epsilon 0.50 were generated in conduits with circular, quadratic, rectangular, and semicircular cross sections utilizing a parallel collective-rearrangement algorithm. The lateral dimensions of the generated packings were chosen to represent typical values encountered in miniaturized liquid chromatography (LC) systems. The interparticle velocity field was calculated using the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method, and a random-walk particle-tracking method was employed to model advective-diffusive transport of an inert tracer in the LB velocity field. We present the morphologies and corresponding flow patterns for these packings and demonstrate that the porosity distribution and velocity profiles of noncylindrical packings deviate significantly from those of conventional cylindrical packings. This deviation becomes more pronounced at higher bed porosities. Extended regions of high local porosity in the corners of noncylindrical conduits give rise to the formation of fluid channels of advanced flow velocity. The differences in the flow velocity distributions of cylindrical and noncylindrical packings are analyzed, and their impact on the axial hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is shown. The presented data support the conclusion that LC performance depends critically on the conduit geometry and bed porosity. Our results have particular relevance for microchip-LC, where noncylindrical conduit geometries are prevalent.},

abstract = {A microfluidic liquid chromatography (LC) system for proteomic investigations that integrates all the necessary components for stand-alone operation, i.e., pump, valve, separation column, and electrospray interface, is described in this paper. The overall size of the LC device is small enough to enable the integration of two fully functional separation systems on a 3 in. 1 in. glass microchip. A multichannel architecture that uses electroosmotic pumping principles provides the necessary functionality for eluent propulsion and sample valving. The flow rates generated within these chips are fully consistent with the requirements of nano-LC platforms that are routinely used in proteomic applications. The microfluidic device was evaluated for the analysis of a protein digest obtained from the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. The cytosolic protein extract was processed according to a shotgun protocol, and after tryptic digestion and prefractionation using strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX), selected sample subfractions were analyzed with conventional and microfluidic LC platforms. Using similar experimental conditions, the performance of the microchip LC was comparable to that obtained with benchtop instrumentation, providing an overlap of 75\% in proteins that were identified by more than two unique peptides. The microfluidic LC analysis of a protein-rich SCX fraction enabled the confident identification of 77 proteins by using conventional data filtering parameters, of 39 proteins with p < 0.001, and of 5 proteins that are known to be cancer-specific biomarkers, demonstrating thus the potential applicability of these chips for future high-throughput biomarker screening applications.},

abstract = {A set of chromatographic materials for bioseparation were characterised by various methods. Both commercial materials and new supports presenting various levels of rigidity were analysed. The methods included size-exclusion and capillary phenomena based techniques. Both batch exclusion and inverse size-exclusion chromatography were used. Gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry and thermoporometry were applied as well as a new method based on water desorption starting from the saturated state. When the rigidity of adsorbents is high enough, the agreement is reasonable between the values of the structural parameters that were determined (surface area, porosity, and pore size) by various methods. Nevertheless, a part of macroporosity may not be evidenced by inverse size-exclusion chromatography whereas it is visible by batch exclusion and the other methods. When the rigidity decreases, for example with soft swelling gels, where standard nitrogen adsorption or mercury porosimetry are no more reliable, two main situations are encountered: either the methods based on capillary phenomena (thermoporometry or water desorption) overestimate the pore size with an amplitude that depends on the method, or in some cases it is possible to distinguish water involved in the swelling of pore walls from that involved in pore filling by capillary condensation.},

Experimental data describing affinity chromatography of lysozyme on Cibacron Blue Sepharose CL-6B is used as a model system.

However, the two most prominent approaches are either based on statistical data analysis or on experimentally validated simulation models. Both approaches heavily rely on experimental data, the generation of which usually imposes a significant bottleneck on rational process design. Hence, here a closed-loop optimization strategy is proposed in that an automated high throughput liquid handling platform is combined with a genetic algorithm. This setup enables process optimization on the mini-scale and thus saves time as well as material costs. The practicability and robustness of the proposed high throughput method is demonstrated with two exemplary optimization tasks: first, optimization of the buffer composition in the capture step for a binary protein mixture (lysozyme and cytochrome), and second, optimization of multilinear gradient elution for the separation of a ternary mixture (ribonuclease and cytochrome, and lysozyme).},

abstract = {Adsorption of proteins on surfaces of hydrophobic interaction chromatography media is at least a two-stage process. Application of pure protein pulses (bovine serum albumin and [beta]-lactoglobulin) to hydrophobic interaction chromatography media yielded two chromatographic peaks at low salt concentrations. At these salt concentrations, the adsorption process is affected by a second reaction, which can be interpreted as protein spreading or partial unfolding of the protein. The kinetic constants of the spreading reaction were derived from pulse response experiments at different residence times and varying concentrations by applying a modified adsorption model considering conformational changes. The obtained parameters were used to calculate uptake and breakthrough curves for spreading proteins. Although these parameters were determined at low saturation of the column, predictions of overloaded situations could match the experimental runs satisfactorily. Our findings suggest that proteins which are sensitive to conformational changes should be loaded at high salt concentrations in order to accelerate the adsorption reaction and to obtain steeper breakthrough curves.},

This study visualized how frit quality affects the flow distribution and the concentration band, the shape of eluted pulse at the colum exit and column efficiency.

abstract = {Strong and weak cation-exchangers were compared for a number of chromatographic parameters, i.e. pH dependence, efficiency, binding strength, particle size distribution, static and dynamic capacity, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures. Chromatographic resins investigated were Fractogel EMD SO3- (M), Fractogel EMD SE Hicap (M), Fractogel EMD COO- (M), MacroPrep 25S, MacroPrep High S, MacroPrep CM, CM HyperZ, and Matrex Cellufine C-500. Testing was done with three proteins: Anti-FVII Mab (IgG), aprotinin, and lysozyme. For lysozyme and aprotinin with pI above experimental pH, dependence of pH on retention was generally low, though some pronounced decrease of retention with increasing pH was observed for CM HyperZ. For Anti-FVII Mab with pI < 7.5, binding was observed on several resins at pH 7.5. Efficiency results present the expected trend of increasing dependence of plate height as a function of increasing flow rate, and the highest flow dependence was observed for Fractogel EMD COO-. Particle size distribution was determined by two independent methods, coulter counting and SEM pictures, with fair agreement. Binding strength data of cation-exchange resins as a function of ionic strength depends on the protein, but binding and elution at high salt concentration may in general be performed with MacroPrep resins. Comparison of dynamic capacity data at 10\% break-through and static capacity measurements shows that a very diverse utilization of approximately 25-90\% of the total available capacity is employed during chromatographic operation. The effect of competitive binding from yeast fermentation components on dynamic binding capacity of aprotinin was studied showing a significant decrease in binding capacity. Sepharose FF, Toyopearl 650 M, and Ceramic HyperD F strong and weak cation-exchange resins were included in this study. Resins with good pure aprotinin capacity also performed well for aprotinin in fermentation broth, but the highest relative capacity was obtained with MacroPrep High S having a fairly low pure component dynamic capacity. Results of this paper may be used in the selection of resins for further testing in biopharmaceutical protein purification process development.},

A new approach to pooling control is presented in a proof-of-concept study. A model-based sensitivity analysis was performed identifying the critical process parameters to product purity and optimal cut points. From this, the robust fixed cut points were found and pooling control strategies for variations in the critical parameters were designed. Direct measurements and indirect measurements based on the UV detector signal were used as control signals. The method is demonstrated for two case studies of preparative protein chromatography: hydrophobic interaction and reversed phase chromatography.

abstract = {Network modeling is a useful tool for investigating pore-scale behavior and in some cases for determining macroscopic information such as permeability, relative permeability, and capillary pressure. Physically representative network models are particularly useful because quantitative and predictive results can be obtained. In the past, network models have been used as stand-alone tools for predicting flow behavior at the pore scale. In these cases, simple boundary conditions such as a pressure gradient in one direction are generally imposed on the network. However, with the increasing emphasis on multiscale modeling techniques, the real potential of network models is as a bridge from the pore to the continuum scale. In this context, continuum-scale and pore-scale models are used jointly; pore-scale behavior is upscaled and substituted into a continuum-scale simulator. Methods for integrating these techniques are being developed, and one important question is how to match boundary conditions for the two scales. In this work, physically representative network models created from computer-generated sphere packings are coupled to adjacent continuum-scale models. By coupling the two regions, realistic boundary conditions are enforced, which reflect the heterogeneity of the packed bed as well as the resistance of the adjacent medium. Results of the direct coupling show that both pore-scale phenomena and macroscopic behavior (such as flowrate) are significantly different than when these same parameters are obtained by implementing simple (decoupled) boundary conditions.},

abstract = {The effective pore diffusivities, De, of five model proteins (ribonuclease A, lysozyme, [alpha]-lactalbumin, ovalbumin, and BSA) in eight commercial phenyl hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) media were determined by analyzing the plate height data from isocratic elution using the first two moments of the general linear rate model. The adsorbents represent a diverse set of HIC media that are widely used for protein purification. The estimated pore diffusivities were used to calculate the elution profiles of proteins in these adsorbents and were compared with the elution profiles obtained experimentally. High protein loading and sample protein concentration led to the underestimation of the pore diffusivity by the linear rate model. Comparisons between the calculated and the experimental profiles suggest that the pore diffusivities obtained from the linear rate model are generally accurate for proteins with low structural flexibility but not for more flexible ones, presumably because conformational change effects contribute significantly to the overall HETP. The general linear rate model was modified to account for the protein folding/unfolding kinetics, and parameter values could be estimated by fitting the experimental elution profiles to the modified model. In addition to conformational change, adsorbent type also had a significant effect on the accuracies of the pore diffusivities estimated by the linear rate model. The results also show that pore diffusion was the rate-limiting step in all absorbents for rigid proteins such as ribonuclease A and lysozyme. For structurally flexible proteins, conformational change contributed significantly to the overall reduced plate heights of the isocratic elution peaks. The physical properties of adsorbents, such as protein accessible porosity, pore size distribution, pore radius and pore connectivity, play important roles in determining the effective protein pore diffusivities.},

@article{Desmet.etal06JoCA,
abstract = {Making a theoretical study supported by experiments of the kinetic advantages of increased inlet pressures versus increased external porosity using impedance plots of analysis time versus required plate number, it is found that both approaches more or less have the same effect on the kinetic performance. The need to change a given system to one with an increased inlet pressure or with an increased external porosity can best be assessed from the optimal plate number (Nopt) of the system. When the pursued application requires a plate number that is larger than Nopt, any increase in inlet pressure and external porosity is beneficial. When the required plate number is smaller than Nopt, any increase in inlet pressure and external porosity should preferentially be accompanied by an overall reduction of the feature sizes of the support. The degree to which this feature size reduction can be realized in practice will to a large extent determine which of the two approaches will be the dominant system of the future.},
